    "## Tokenization and words\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tokenization** is the process of segmenting text into smaller units, called **tokens**, which may be sentences, words, or sub-word chunks. It is typically the first step in a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline and can be carried out by a variety of tokenizers, each reflecting different design choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple approach to word tokenization splits text on whitespace and punctuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Now that summer's here, we're going to visit the beach at Lake Michigan and eat ice cream.\n",
    "\n",
    "By splitting on whitespace only, we would get in this case 17 words: \n",
    "\n",
    "> Now, that, summer's, here, we're, going, to, visit, the, beach, at, Lake, Michigan, and, eat, ice, cream.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this raises questions: should “Lake Michigan” count as one token or two? Is “we’re” one word or two? Should “going” be treated differently from “go” or “went”?  \n",
    "\n",
    "These challenges reveal that even the seemingly straightforward **concept of a “word”** becomes complicated when formalized for computational analysis. This is why more advanced tokenization methods, such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), WordPiece, and SentencePiece, were developed to address these issues in modern language models like BERT and GPT. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at a few examples of traditional tokenizers with a goal of gathering tokens into one-, two-, and three-word constructions. The general name for these is **n-grams**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **n-gram** is a **sequence of n items from a given sample of text or speech**. Most often, this refers to a sequence of words, but it can also be used to analyze text at the level of syllables, letters, or phonemes. N-grams are often described by their length. For example, word n-grams might include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* stock (a 1-gram, or **unigram**)\n",
    "* vegetable stock (a 2-gram, or **bigram**)\n",
    "* homemade vegetable stock (a 3-gram, or **trigram**)\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing text through n-grams allows us to capture meaning that extends beyond single words. By looking only at unigrams would not be able, for example, to differentiate between the \"stock\" in \"stock market\" and \"vegetable stock.\" By including bigrams and trigrams in our analysis, we are able to look at concepts that extend across multiple words. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular examples of text analysis with n-grams is the [Google N-Gram Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams)."

I take it much unkindly\\nThat thou, Iago, who hast had my purse\\nAs if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.\\n\\nIAGO  \\'Sblood, but you\\'ll not hear me!\\nIf ever I did dream of such a matter,\\nAbhor me.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\nThou toldst me thou didst hold him in thy hate.\\n\\nIAGO  Despise me\\nIf I do not. Three great ones of the city,\\nIn personal suit to make me his lieutenant,\\nOff-capped to him; and, by the faith of man,\\nI know my price, I am worth no worse a place.\\nBut he, as loving his own pride and purposes,\\nEvades them with a bombast circumstance,\\nHorribly stuffed with epithets of war,\\nAnd in conclusion,\\nNonsuits my mediators. For \"Certes,\" says he,\\n\"I have already chose my officer.\"\\nAnd what was he?\\nForsooth, a great arithmetician,\\nOne Michael Cassio, a Florentine,\\nA fellow almost damned in a fair wife,\\nThat never set a squadron in the field,\\nNor the division of a battle knows\\nMore than a spinster--unless the bookish theoric,\\nWherein the toged consuls can propose\\nAs masterly as he. Mere prattle without practice\\nIs all his soldiership. But he, sir, had th\\' election;\\nAnd I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof\\nAt Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds\\nChristened and heathen, must be beleed and\\ncalmed\\nBy debitor and creditor. This countercaster,\\nHe, in good time, must his lieutenant be,\\nAnd I, God bless the mark, his Moorship\\'s ancient.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\nBy heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.\\n\\nIAGO\\nWhy, there\\'s no remedy. \\'Tis the curse of service.\\nPreferment goes by letter and affection,\\nAnd not by old gradation, where each second\\nStood heir to th\\' first. Now, sir, be judge yourself\\nWhether I in any just term am affined\\nTo love the Moor.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\nI would not follow him, then.\\n\\nIAGO  O, sir, content you.\\nI follow him to serve my turn upon him.\\nWe cannot all be masters, nor all masters\\nCannot be truly followed. You shall mark\\nMany a duteous and knee-crooking knave\\nThat, doting on his own obsequious bondage,\\nWears out his time, much like his master\\'s ass,\\nFor naught but provender, and when he\\'s old,\\ncashiered.\\nWhip me such honest knaves! Others there are\\nWho, trimmed in forms and visages of duty,\\nKeep yet their hearts attending on themselves,\\nAnd, throwing but shows of service on their lords,\\nDo well thrive by them; and when they have lined\\ntheir coats,\\nDo themselves homage. These fellows have some\\nsoul,\\nAnd such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,\\nIt is as sure as you are Roderigo,\\nWere I the Moor I would not be Iago.\\nIn following him, I follow but myself.\\nHeaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,\\nBut seeming so for my peculiar end.\\nFor when my outward action doth demonstrate\\nThe native act and figure of my heart\\nIn complement extern, \\'tis not long after\\nBut I will wear my heart upon my sleeve\\nFor daws to peck at. I am not what I am.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\nWhat a full fortune does the thick-lips owe\\nIf he can carry \\'t thus!\\n\\nIAGO  Call up her father.\\nRouse him. Make after him, poison his delight,\\nProclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,\\nAnd, though he in a fertile climate dwell,\\nPlague him with flies. Though that his joy be joy,\\nYet throw such chances of vexation on \\'t\\nAs it may lose some color.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\nHere is her father\\'s house. I\\'ll call aloud.\\n\\nIAGO\\nDo, with like timorous accent and dire yell\\nAs when, by night and negligence, the fire\\nIs spied in populous cities.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\nWhat ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!\\n\\nIAGO\\nAwake! What ho, Brabantio! Thieves, thieves!\\nLook to your house, your daughter, and your bags!\\nThieves, thieves!\\n\\n[Enter Brabantio, above.]\\n\\n\\nBRABANTIO\\nWhat is the reason of this terrible summons?\\nWhat is the matter there?\\n\\nRODERIGO\\nSignior, is all your family within?\\n\\nIAGO\\nAre your doors locked?\\n\\nBRABANTIO  Why, wherefore ask you this?\\n\\nIAGO\\nZounds, sir, you\\'re robbed. For shame, put on your\\ngown!\\nYour heart is burst. You have lost half your soul.\\nEven now, now, very now, an old black ram\\nIs tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise!\\nAwake the snorting citizens with the bell,\\nOr else the devil will make a grandsire of you.\\nArise, I say!\\n\\nBRABANTIO  What, have you lost your wits?\\n\\nRODERIGO\\nMost reverend signior, do you know my voice?\\n\\nBRABANTIO  Not I. What are you?\\n\\nRODERIGO\\nMy name is Roderigo.\\n\\nBRABANTIO  The worser welcome.\\nI have charged thee not to haunt about my doors.\\nIn honest plainness thou hast heard me say\\nMy daughter is not for thee. And now in madness,\\nBeing full of supper and distemp\\'ring draughts,\\nUpon malicious bravery dost thou come\\nTo start my quiet.\\n\\nRODERIGO  Sir, sir, sir--\\n\\nBRABANTIO  But thou must needs be sure\\nMy spirit and my place have in them power\\nTo make this bitter to thee.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\nPatience, good sir.\\n\\nBRABANTIO  What tell\\'st thou me of robbing?\\nThis is Venice. My house is not a grange.\\n\\nRODERIGO  Most grave Brabantio,\\nIn simple and pure soul I come to you--\\n\\nIAGO  Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not\\nserve God if the devil bid you. Because we come to\\ndo you service and you think we are ruffians, you\\'ll\\nhave your daughter covered with a Barbary horse,\\nyou\\'ll have your nephews neigh to you, you\\'ll have\\ncoursers for cousins and jennets for germans.\\n\\nBRABANTIO  What profane wretch art thou?\\n\\nIAGO  I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter\\nand the Moor are now making the beast with\\ntwo backs.\\n\\nBRABANTIO  Thou art a villain.\\n\\nIAGO  You are a senator.\\n\\nBRABANTIO\\nThis thou shalt answer. I know thee, Roderigo.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\nSir, I will answer anything. But I beseech you,\\nIf \\'t be your pleasure and most wise consent--\\nAs partly I find it is--that your fair daughter,\\nAt this odd-even and dull watch o\\' th\\' night,\\nTransported with no worse nor better guard\\nBut with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,\\nTo the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor:\\nIf this be known to you, and your allowance,\\nWe then have done you bold and saucy wrongs.\\nBut if you know not this, my manners tell me\\nWe have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe\\nThat from the sense of all civility\\nI thus would play and trifle with your Reverence.\\nYour daughter, if you have not given her leave,\\nI say again, hath made a gross revolt,\\nTying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes\\nIn an extravagant and wheeling stranger\\nOf here and everywhere. Straight satisfy yourself.\\nIf she be in her chamber or your house,\\nLet loose on me the justice of the state\\nFor thus deluding you.\\n\\nBRABANTIO  Strike on the tinder, ho!\\nGive me a taper. Call up all my people.\\nThis accident is not unlike my dream.\\nBelief of it oppresses me already.\\nLight, I say, light!\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nIAGO, [to Roderigo]  Farewell, for I must leave you.\\nIt seems not meet nor wholesome to my place\\nTo be producted, as if I stay I shall,\\nAgainst the Moor. For I do know the state,\\nHowever this may gall him with some check,\\nCannot with safety cast him, for he\\'s embarked\\nWith such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,\\nWhich even now stands in act, that, for their souls,\\nAnother of his fathom they have none\\nTo lead their business. In which regard,\\nThough I do hate him as I do hell pains,\\nYet, for necessity of present life,\\nI must show out a flag and sign of love--\\nWhich is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find\\nhim,\\nLead to the Sagittary the raised search,\\nAnd there will I be with him. So, farewell.\\t[He exits.]\\n\\n[Enter Brabantio in his nightgown, with Servants and\\nTorches.]\\n\\n\\nBRABANTIO\\nIt is too true an evil. Gone she is,\\nAnd what\\'s to come of my despised time\\nIs naught but bitterness.--Now, Roderigo,\\nWhere didst thou see her?--O, unhappy girl!--\\nWith the Moor, sayst thou?--Who would be a\\nfather?--\\nHow didst thou know \\'twas she?--O, she deceives\\nme\\nPast thought!--What said she to you?--Get more\\ntapers.\\nRaise all my kindred.--Are they married, think\\nyou?\\n\\nRODERIGO  Truly, I think they are.\\n\\nBRABANTIO\\nO heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!\\nFathers, from hence trust not your daughters\\' minds\\nBy what you see them act.--Is there not charms\\nBy which the property of youth and maidhood\\nMay be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,\\nOf some such thing?\\n\\nRODERIGO  Yes, sir, I have indeed.\\n\\nBRABANTIO\\nCall up my brother.--O, would you had had her!--\\nSome one way, some another.--Do you know\\nWhere we may apprehend her and the Moor?\\n\\nRODERIGO\\nI think I can discover him, if you please\\nTo get good guard and go along with me.\\n\\nBRABANTIO\\nPray you lead on. At every house I\\'ll call.\\nI may command at most.--Get weapons, ho!\\nAnd raise some special officers of night.--\\nOn, good Roderigo. I will deserve your pains.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 2\\n=======\\n[Enter Othello, Iago, Attendants, with Torches.]\\n\\n\\nIAGO\\nThough in the trade of war I have slain men,\\nYet do I hold it very stuff o\\' th\\' conscience\\nTo do no contrived murder. I lack iniquity\\nSometimes to do me service. Nine or ten times\\nI had thought t\\' have yerked him here under the\\nribs.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\n\\'Tis better as it is.\\n\\nIAGO  Nay, but he prated\\nAnd spoke such scurvy and provoking terms\\nAgainst your Honor,\\nThat with the little godliness I have\\nI did full hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir,\\nAre you fast married? Be assured of this,\\nThat the magnifico is much beloved,\\nAnd hath in his effect a voice potential\\nAs double as the Duke\\'s. He will divorce you\\nOr put upon you what restraint or grievance\\nThe law (with all his might to enforce it on)\\nWill give him cable.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Let him do his spite.\\nMy services which I have done the signiory\\nShall out-tongue his complaints. \\'Tis yet to know\\n(Which, when I know that boasting is an honor,\\nI shall promulgate) I fetch my life and being\\nFrom men of royal siege, and my demerits\\nMay speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune\\nAs this that I have reached. For know, Iago,\\nBut that I love the gentle Desdemona,\\nI would not my unhoused free condition\\nPut into circumscription and confine\\nFor the sea\\'s worth. But look, what lights come\\nyond?\\n\\nIAGO\\nThose are the raised father and his friends.\\nYou were best go in.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Not I. I must be found.\\nMy parts, my title, and my perfect soul\\nShall manifest me rightly. Is it they?\\n\\nIAGO  By Janus, I think no.\\n\\n[Enter Cassio, with Officers, and Torches.]\\n\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nThe servants of the Duke and my lieutenant!\\nThe goodness of the night upon you, friends.\\nWhat is the news?\\n\\nCASSIO  The Duke does greet you, general,\\nAnd he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,\\nEven on the instant.\\n\\nOTHELLO  What is the matter, think you?\\n\\nCASSIO\\nSomething from Cyprus, as I may divine.\\nIt is a business of some heat. The galleys\\nHave sent a dozen sequent messengers\\nThis very night at one another\\'s heels,\\nAnd many of the Consuls, raised and met,\\nAre at the Duke\\'s already. You have been hotly\\ncalled for.\\nWhen, being not at your lodging to be found,\\nThe Senate hath sent about three several quests\\nTo search you out.\\n\\nOTHELLO  \\'Tis well I am found by you.\\nI will but spend a word here in the house\\nAnd go with you.\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nCASSIO  Ancient, what makes he here?\\n\\nIAGO\\nFaith, he tonight hath boarded a land carrack.\\nIf it prove lawful prize, he\\'s made forever.\\n\\nCASSIO\\nI do not understand.\\n\\nIAGO  He\\'s married.\\n\\nCASSIO  To who?\\n\\nIAGO\\nMarry, to--\\n\\n[Reenter Othello.]\\n\\nCome, captain, will you go?\\n\\nOTHELLO  Have with you.\\n\\nCASSIO\\nHere comes another troop to seek for you.\\n\\n[Enter Brabantio, Roderigo, with Officers, and Torches.]\\n\\n\\nIAGO\\nIt is Brabantio. General, be advised,\\nHe comes to bad intent.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Holla, stand there!\\n\\nRODERIGO\\nSignior, it is the Moor.\\n\\nBRABANTIO  Down with him,\\nthief!\\n[They draw their swords.]\\n\\nIAGO\\nYou, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nKeep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust\\nthem.\\nGood signior, you shall more command with years\\nThan with your weapons.\\n\\nBRABANTIO\\nO, thou foul thief, where hast thou stowed my\\ndaughter?\\nDamned as thou art, thou hast enchanted her!\\nFor I\\'ll refer me to all things of sense,\\nIf she in chains of magic were not bound,\\nWhether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,\\nSo opposite to marriage that she shunned\\nThe wealthy curled darlings of our nation,\\nWould ever have, t\\' incur a general mock,\\nRun from her guardage to the sooty bosom\\nOf such a thing as thou--to fear, not to delight!\\nJudge me the world, if \\'tis not gross in sense\\nThat thou hast practiced on her with foul charms,\\nAbused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals\\nThat weakens motion. I\\'ll have \\'t disputed on.\\n\\'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.\\nI therefore apprehend and do attach thee\\nFor an abuser of the world, a practicer\\nOf arts inhibited and out of warrant.--\\nLay hold upon him. If he do resist,\\nSubdue him at his peril.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Hold your hands,\\nBoth you of my inclining and the rest.\\nWere it my cue to fight, I should have known it\\nWithout a prompter.--Whither will you that I go\\nTo answer this your charge?\\n\\nBRABANTIO  To prison, till fit time\\nOf law and course of direct session\\nCall thee to answer.\\n\\nOTHELLO  What if I do obey?\\nHow may the Duke be therewith satisfied,\\nWhose messengers are here about my side,\\nUpon some present business of the state,\\nTo bring me to him?\\n\\nOFFICER  \\'Tis true, most worthy signior.\\nThe Duke\\'s in council, and your noble self\\nI am sure is sent for.\\n\\nBRABANTIO  How? The Duke in council?\\nIn this time of the night? Bring him away;\\nMine\\'s not an idle cause. The Duke himself,\\nOr any of my brothers of the state,\\nCannot but feel this wrong as \\'twere their own.\\nFor if such actions may have passage free,\\nBondslaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 3\\n=======\\n[Enter Duke, Senators, and Officers.]\\n\\n\\nDUKE, [reading a paper]\\nThere\\'s no composition in these news\\nThat gives them credit.\\n\\nFIRST SENATOR, [reading a paper]\\nIndeed, they are disproportioned.\\nMy letters say a hundred and seven galleys.\\n\\nDUKE\\nAnd mine, a hundred forty.\\n\\nSECOND SENATOR, [reading a paper]\\nAnd mine, two hundred.\\nBut though they jump not on a just account\\n(As in these cases, where the aim reports\\n\\'Tis oft with difference), yet do they all confirm\\nA Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.\\n\\nDUKE\\nNay, it is possible enough to judgment.\\nI do not so secure me in the error,\\nBut the main article I do approve\\nIn fearful sense.\\n\\nSAILOR, [within]  What ho, what ho, what ho!\\n\\n[Enter Sailor.]\\n\\n\\nOFFICER  A messenger from the galleys.\\n\\nDUKE  Now, what\\'s the business?\\n\\nSAILOR\\nThe Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes.\\nSo was I bid report here to the state\\nBy Signior Angelo.\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nDUKE\\nHow say you by this change?\\n\\nFIRST SENATOR  This cannot be,\\nBy no assay of reason. \\'Tis a pageant\\nTo keep us in false gaze. When we consider\\nTh\\' importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,\\nAnd let ourselves again but understand\\nThat, as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,\\nSo may he with more facile question bear it,\\nFor that it stands not in such warlike brace,\\nBut altogether lacks th\\' abilities\\nThat Rhodes is dressed in--if we make thought of\\nthis,\\nWe must not think the Turk is so unskillful\\nTo leave that latest which concerns him first,\\nNeglecting an attempt of ease and gain\\nTo wake and wage a danger profitless.\\n\\nDUKE\\nNay, in all confidence, he\\'s not for Rhodes.\\n\\nOFFICER  Here is more news.\\n\\n[Enter a Messenger.]\\n\\n\\nMESSENGER\\nThe Ottomites, Reverend and Gracious,\\nSteering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes,\\nHave there injointed them with an after fleet.\\n\\nFIRST SENATOR\\nAy, so I thought. How many, as you guess?\\n\\nMESSENGER\\nOf thirty sail; and now they do restem\\nTheir backward course, bearing with frank\\nappearance\\nTheir purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,\\nYour trusty and most valiant servitor,\\nWith his free duty recommends you thus,\\nAnd prays you to believe him.\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nDUKE  \\'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.\\nMarcus Luccicos, is not he in town?\\n\\nFIRST SENATOR\\nHe\\'s now in Florence.\\n\\nDUKE  Write from us to him.\\nPost-post-haste. Dispatch.\\n\\nFIRST SENATOR\\nHere comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.\\n\\n[Enter Brabantio, Othello, Cassio, Iago, Roderigo, and\\nOfficers.]\\n\\n\\nDUKE\\nValiant Othello, we must straight employ you\\nAgainst the general enemy Ottoman.\\n[To Brabantio.] I did not see you. Welcome, gentle\\nsignior.\\nWe lacked your counsel and your help tonight.\\n\\nBRABANTIO\\nSo did I yours. Good your Grace, pardon me.\\nNeither my place nor aught I heard of business\\nHath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general\\ncare\\nTake hold on me, for my particular grief\\nIs of so floodgate and o\\'erbearing nature\\nThat it engluts and swallows other sorrows\\nAnd it is still itself.\\n\\nDUKE  Why, what\\'s the matter?\\n\\nBRABANTIO\\nMy daughter! O, my daughter!\\n\\nFIRST SENATOR  Dead?\\n\\nBRABANTIO  Ay, to me.\\nShe is abused, stol\\'n from me, and corrupted\\nBy spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;\\nFor nature so prepost\\'rously to err--\\nBeing not deficient, blind, or lame of sense--\\nSans witchcraft could not.\\n\\nDUKE\\nWhoe\\'er he be that in this foul proceeding\\nHath thus beguiled your daughter of herself\\nAnd you of her, the bloody book of law\\nYou shall yourself read in the bitter letter,\\nAfter your own sense, yea, though our proper son\\nStood in your action.\\n\\nBRABANTIO  Humbly I thank your Grace.\\nHere is the man--this Moor, whom now it seems\\nYour special mandate for the state affairs\\nHath hither brought.\\n\\nALL  We are very sorry for \\'t.\\n\\nDUKE, [to Othello]\\nWhat, in your own part, can you say to this?\\n\\nBRABANTIO  Nothing, but this is so.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nMost potent, grave, and reverend signiors,\\nMy very noble and approved good masters:\\nThat I have ta\\'en away this old man\\'s daughter,\\nIt is most true; true I have married her.\\nThe very head and front of my offending\\nHath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,\\nAnd little blessed with the soft phrase of peace;\\nFor since these arms of mine had seven years\\' pith,\\nTill now some nine moons wasted, they have used\\nTheir dearest action in the tented field,\\nAnd little of this great world can I speak\\nMore than pertains to feats of broil and battle.\\nAnd therefore little shall I grace my cause\\nIn speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious\\npatience,\\nI will a round unvarnished tale deliver\\nOf my whole course of love--what drugs, what\\ncharms,\\nWhat conjuration, and what mighty magic\\n(For such proceeding I am charged withal)\\nI won his daughter.\\n\\nBRABANTIO  A maiden never bold,\\nOf spirit so still and quiet that her motion\\nBlushed at herself. And she, in spite of nature,\\nOf years, of country, credit, everything,\\nTo fall in love with what she feared to look on!\\nIt is a judgment maimed and most imperfect\\nThat will confess perfection so could err\\nAgainst all rules of nature, and must be driven\\nTo find out practices of cunning hell\\nWhy this should be. I therefore vouch again\\nThat with some mixtures powerful o\\'er the blood,\\nOr with some dram conjured to this effect,\\nHe wrought upon her.\\n\\nDUKE  To vouch this is no proof\\nWithout more wider and more overt test\\nThan these thin habits and poor likelihoods\\nOf modern seeming do prefer against him.\\n\\nFIRST SENATOR  But, Othello, speak:\\nDid you by indirect and forced courses\\nSubdue and poison this young maid\\'s affections?\\nOr came it by request, and such fair question\\nAs soul to soul affordeth?\\n\\nOTHELLO  I do beseech you,\\nSend for the lady to the Sagittary\\nAnd let her speak of me before her father.\\nIf you do find me foul in her report,\\nThe trust, the office I do hold of you,\\nNot only take away, but let your sentence\\nEven fall upon my life.\\n\\nDUKE  Fetch Desdemona hither.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nAncient, conduct them. You best know the place.\\n[Iago and Attendants exit.]\\nAnd till she come, as truly as to heaven\\nI do confess the vices of my blood,\\nSo justly to your grave ears I\\'ll present\\nHow I did thrive in this fair lady\\'s love,\\nAnd she in mine.\\n\\nDUKE  Say it, Othello.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nHer father loved me, oft invited me,\\nStill questioned me the story of my life\\nFrom year to year--the battles, sieges, fortunes\\nThat I have passed.\\nI ran it through, even from my boyish days\\nTo th\\' very moment that he bade me tell it,\\nWherein I spoke of most disastrous chances:\\nOf moving accidents by flood and field,\\nOf hairbreadth \\'scapes i\\' th\\' imminent deadly\\nbreach,\\nOf being taken by the insolent foe\\nAnd sold to slavery, of my redemption thence,\\nAnd portance in my traveler\\'s history,\\nWherein of antres vast and deserts idle,\\nRough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads\\ntouch heaven,\\nIt was my hint to speak--such was my process--\\nAnd of the cannibals that each other eat,\\nThe Anthropophagi, and men whose heads\\nDo grow beneath their shoulders. These things to\\nhear\\nWould Desdemona seriously incline.\\nBut still the house affairs would draw her thence,\\nWhich ever as she could with haste dispatch\\nShe\\'d come again, and with a greedy ear\\nDevour up my discourse. Which I, observing,\\nTook once a pliant hour, and found good means\\nTo draw from her a prayer of earnest heart\\nThat I would all my pilgrimage dilate,\\nWhereof by parcels she had something heard,\\nBut not intentively. I did consent,\\nAnd often did beguile her of her tears\\nWhen I did speak of some distressful stroke\\nThat my youth suffered. My story being done,\\nShe gave me for my pains a world of sighs.\\nShe swore, in faith, \\'twas strange, \\'twas passing\\nstrange,\\n\\'Twas pitiful, \\'twas wondrous pitiful.\\nShe wished she had not heard it, yet she wished\\nThat heaven had made her such a man. She thanked\\nme,\\nAnd bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,\\nI should but teach him how to tell my story,\\nAnd that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake.\\nShe loved me for the dangers I had passed,\\nAnd I loved her that she did pity them.\\nThis only is the witchcraft I have used.\\nHere comes the lady. Let her witness it.\\n\\n[Enter Desdemona, Iago, Attendants.]\\n\\n\\nDUKE\\nI think this tale would win my daughter, too.\\nGood Brabantio,\\nTake up this mangled matter at the best.\\nMen do their broken weapons rather use\\nThan their bare hands.\\n\\nBRABANTIO  I pray you hear her speak.\\nIf she confess that she was half the wooer,\\nDestruction on my head if my bad blame\\nLight on the man.--Come hither, gentle mistress.\\nDo you perceive in all this noble company\\nWhere most you owe obedience?\\n\\nDESDEMONA  My noble father,\\nI do perceive here a divided duty.\\nTo you I am bound for life and education.\\nMy life and education both do learn me\\nHow to respect you. You are the lord of duty.\\nI am hitherto your daughter. But here\\'s my\\nhusband.\\nAnd so much duty as my mother showed\\nTo you, preferring you before her father,\\nSo much I challenge that I may profess\\nDue to the Moor my lord.\\n\\nBRABANTIO  God be with you! I have done.\\nPlease it your Grace, on to the state affairs.\\nI had rather to adopt a child than get it.--\\nCome hither, Moor.\\nI here do give thee that with all my heart\\nWhich, but thou hast already, with all my heart\\nI would keep from thee.--For your sake, jewel,\\nI am glad at soul I have no other child,\\nFor thy escape would teach me tyranny,\\nTo hang clogs on them.--I have done, my lord.\\n\\nDUKE\\nLet me speak like yourself and lay a sentence,\\nWhich as a grise or step may help these lovers\\nInto your favor.\\nWhen remedies are past, the griefs are ended\\nBy seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.\\nTo mourn a mischief that is past and gone\\nIs the next way to draw new mischief on.\\nWhat cannot be preserved when fortune takes,\\nPatience her injury a mock\\'ry makes.\\nThe robbed that smiles steals something from the\\nthief;\\nHe robs himself that spends a bootless grief.\\n\\nBRABANTIO\\nSo let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile,\\nWe lose it not so long as we can smile.\\nHe bears the sentence well that nothing bears\\nBut the free comfort which from thence he hears;\\nBut he bears both the sentence and the sorrow\\nThat, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.\\nThese sentences to sugar or to gall,\\nBeing strong on both sides, are equivocal.\\nBut words are words. I never yet did hear\\nThat the bruised heart was pierced through the\\near.\\nI humbly beseech you, proceed to th\\' affairs of\\nstate.\\n\\nDUKE  The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes\\nfor Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is\\nbest known to you. And though we have there a\\nsubstitute of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a\\nsovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer\\nvoice on you. You must therefore be content to\\nslubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this\\nmore stubborn and boist\\'rous expedition.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nThe tyrant custom, most grave senators,\\nHath made the flinty and steel couch of war\\nMy thrice-driven bed of down. I do agnize\\nA natural and prompt alacrity\\nI find in hardness, and do undertake\\nThis present wars against the Ottomites.\\nMost humbly, therefore, bending to your state,\\nI crave fit disposition for my wife,\\nDue reference of place and exhibition,\\nWith such accommodation and besort\\nAs levels with her breeding.\\n\\nDUKE\\nWhy, at her father\\'s.\\n\\nBRABANTIO  I will not have it so.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Nor I.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Nor would I there reside\\nTo put my father in impatient thoughts\\nBy being in his eye. Most gracious duke,\\nTo my unfolding lend your prosperous ear\\nAnd let me find a charter in your voice\\nT\\' assist my simpleness.\\n\\nDUKE  What would you, Desdemona?\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nThat I love the Moor to live with him\\nMy downright violence and storm of fortunes\\nMay trumpet to the world. My heart\\'s subdued\\nEven to the very quality of my lord.\\nI saw Othello\\'s visage in his mind,\\nAnd to his honors and his valiant parts\\nDid I my soul and fortunes consecrate.\\nSo that, dear lords, if I be left behind,\\nA moth of peace, and he go to the war,\\nThe rites for why I love him are bereft me\\nAnd I a heavy interim shall support\\nBy his dear absence. Let me go with him.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Let her have your voice.\\nVouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not\\nTo please the palate of my appetite,\\nNor to comply with heat (the young affects\\nIn me defunct) and proper satisfaction,\\nBut to be free and bounteous to her mind.\\nAnd heaven defend your good souls that you think\\nI will your serious and great business scant\\nFor she is with me. No, when light-winged toys\\nOf feathered Cupid seel with wanton dullness\\nMy speculative and officed instruments,\\nThat my disports corrupt and taint my business,\\nLet housewives make a skillet of my helm,\\nAnd all indign and base adversities\\nMake head against my estimation.\\n\\nDUKE\\nBe it as you shall privately determine,\\nEither for her stay or going. Th\\' affair cries haste,\\nAnd speed must answer it.\\n\\nFIRST SENATOR\\nYou must away tonight.\\n\\nOTHELLO  With all my\\nheart.\\n\\nDUKE\\nAt nine i\\' th\\' morning here we\\'ll meet again.\\nOthello, leave some officer behind\\nAnd he shall our commission bring to you,\\nWith such things else of quality and respect\\nAs doth import you.\\n\\nOTHELLO  So please your Grace, my\\nancient.\\nA man he is of honesty and trust.\\nTo his conveyance I assign my wife,\\nWith what else needful your good Grace shall think\\nTo be sent after me.\\n\\nDUKE  Let it be so.\\nGood night to everyone. [To Brabantio.] And, noble\\nsignior,\\nIf virtue no delighted beauty lack,\\nYour son-in-law is far more fair than black.\\n\\nFIRST SENATOR\\nAdieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.\\n\\nBRABANTIO\\nLook to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see.\\nShe has deceived her father, and may thee.\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nMy life upon her faith!\\n[The Duke, the Senators, Cassio, and Officers exit.]\\nHonest Iago,\\nMy Desdemona must I leave to thee.\\nI prithee let thy wife attend on her,\\nAnd bring them after in the best advantage.--\\nCome, Desdemona, I have but an hour\\nOf love, of worldly matters, and direction\\nTo spend with thee. We must obey the time.\\n[Othello and Desdemona exit.]\\n\\nRODERIGO  Iago--\\n\\nIAGO  What sayst thou, noble heart?\\n\\nRODERIGO  What will I do, think\\'st thou?\\n\\nIAGO  Why, go to bed and sleep.\\n\\nRODERIGO  I will incontinently drown myself.\\n\\nIAGO  If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,\\nthou silly gentleman!\\n\\nRODERIGO  It is silliness to live, when to live is torment,\\nand then have we a prescription to die when death is\\nour physician.\\n\\nIAGO  O, villainous! I have looked upon the world for\\nfour times seven years, and since I could distinguish\\nbetwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found\\nman that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say\\nI would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, I\\nwould change my humanity with a baboon.\\n\\nRODERIGO  What should I do? I confess it is my shame\\nto be so fond, but it is not in my virtue to amend it.\\n\\nIAGO  Virtue? A fig! \\'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or\\nthus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our\\nwills are gardeners. So that if we will plant nettles\\nor sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme,\\nsupply it with one gender of herbs or distract it\\nwith many, either to have it sterile with idleness or\\nmanured with industry, why the power and corrigible\\nauthority of this lies in our wills. If the balance\\nof our lives had not one scale of reason to poise\\nanother of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our\\nnatures would conduct us to most prepost\\'rous\\nconclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging\\nmotions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts--\\nwhereof I take this that you call love to be a sect, or\\nscion.\\n\\nRODERIGO  It cannot be.\\n\\nIAGO  It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission\\nof the will. Come, be a man! Drown thyself? Drown\\ncats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy\\nfriend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving\\nwith cables of perdurable toughness. I could never\\nbetter stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse.\\nFollow thou the wars; defeat thy favor with an\\nusurped beard. I say, put money in thy purse. It\\ncannot be that Desdemona should long continue\\nher love to the Moor--put money in thy purse--\\nnor he his to her. It was a violent commencement in\\nher, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration\\n--put but money in thy purse. These Moors are\\nchangeable in their wills. Fill thy purse with money.\\nThe food that to him now is as luscious as locusts\\nshall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida.\\nShe must change for youth. When she is sated\\nwith his body she will find the error of her choice.\\nTherefore, put money in thy purse. If thou wilt\\nneeds damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than\\ndrowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony\\nand a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian\\nand a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my\\nwits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her.\\nTherefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself!\\nIt is clean out of the way. Seek thou rather to be\\nhanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned\\nand go without her.\\n\\nRODERIGO  Wilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on\\nthe issue?\\n\\nIAGO  Thou art sure of me. Go, make money. I have\\ntold thee often, and I retell thee again and again, I\\nhate the Moor. My cause is hearted; thine hath no\\nless reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge\\nagainst him. If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost\\nthyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many\\nevents in the womb of time which will be delivered.\\nTraverse, go, provide thy money. We will have more\\nof this tomorrow. Adieu.\\n\\nRODERIGO  Where shall we meet i\\' th\\' morning?\\n\\nIAGO  At my lodging.\\n\\nRODERIGO  I\\'ll be with thee betimes.\\n\\nIAGO  Go to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?\\n\\nRODERIGO  What say you?\\n\\nIAGO  No more of drowning, do you hear?\\n\\nRODERIGO  I am changed.\\n\\nIAGO  Go to, farewell. Put money enough in your\\npurse.\\n\\nRODERIGO  I\\'ll sell all my land.\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nIAGO\\nThus do I ever make my fool my purse.\\nFor I mine own gained knowledge should profane\\nIf I would time expend with such a snipe\\nBut for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor,\\nAnd it is thought abroad that \\'twixt my sheets\\n\\'Has done my office. I know not if \\'t be true,\\nBut I, for mere suspicion in that kind,\\nWill do as if for surety. He holds me well.\\nThe better shall my purpose work on him.\\nCassio\\'s a proper man. Let me see now:\\nTo get his place and to plume up my will\\nIn double knavery--How? how?--Let\\'s see.\\nAfter some time, to abuse Othello\\'s ear\\nThat he is too familiar with his wife.\\nHe hath a person and a smooth dispose\\nTo be suspected, framed to make women false.\\nThe Moor is of a free and open nature\\nThat thinks men honest that but seem to be so,\\nAnd will as tenderly be led by th\\' nose\\nAs asses are.\\nI have \\'t. It is engendered. Hell and night\\nMust bring this monstrous birth to the world\\'s light.\\n[He exits.]\\n\\n\\nACT 2\\n=====\\n\\nScene 1\\n=======\\n[Enter Montano and two Gentlemen.]\\n\\n\\nMONTANO\\nWhat from the cape can you discern at sea?\\n\\nFIRST GENTLEMAN\\nNothing at all. It is a high-wrought flood.\\nI cannot \\'twixt the heaven and the main\\nDescry a sail.\\n\\nMONTANO\\nMethinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land.\\nA fuller blast ne\\'er shook our battlements.\\nIf it hath ruffianed so upon the sea,\\nWhat ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,\\nCan hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?\\n\\nSECOND GENTLEMAN\\nA segregation of the Turkish fleet.\\nFor do but stand upon the foaming shore,\\nThe chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds,\\nThe wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous\\nmane,\\nSeems to cast water on the burning Bear\\nAnd quench the guards of th\\' ever-fixed pole.\\nI never did like molestation view\\nOn the enchafed flood.\\n\\nMONTANO  If that the Turkish fleet\\nBe not ensheltered and embayed, they are drowned.\\nIt is impossible to bear it out.\\n\\n[Enter a third Gentleman.]\\n\\n\\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN  News, lads! Our wars are done.\\nThe desperate tempest hath so banged the Turks\\nThat their designment halts. A noble ship of Venice\\nHath seen a grievous wrack and sufferance\\nOn most part of their fleet.\\n\\nMONTANO\\nHow? Is this true?\\n\\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN  The ship is here put in,\\nA Veronesa. Michael Cassio,\\nLieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,\\nIs come on shore; the Moor himself at sea,\\nAnd is in full commission here for Cyprus.\\n\\nMONTANO\\nI am glad on \\'t. \\'Tis a worthy governor.\\n\\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN\\nBut this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort\\nTouching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly\\nAnd prays the Moor be safe, for they were parted\\nWith foul and violent tempest.\\n\\nMONTANO  Pray heaven he be;\\nFor I have served him, and the man commands\\nLike a full soldier. Let\\'s to the seaside, ho!\\nAs well to see the vessel that\\'s come in\\nAs to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,\\nEven till we make the main and th\\' aerial blue\\nAn indistinct regard.\\n\\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN  Come, let\\'s do so;\\nFor every minute is expectancy\\nOf more arrivance.\\n\\n[Enter Cassio.]\\n\\n\\nCASSIO\\nThanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,\\nThat so approve the Moor!

How if she be black and witty?\\n\\nIAGO\\n\\tIf she be black, and thereto have a wit,\\n\\tShe\\'ll find a white that shall her blackness hit.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nWorse and worse.\\n\\nEMILIA  How if fair and foolish?\\n\\nIAGO\\n\\tShe never yet was foolish that was fair,\\n\\tFor even her folly helped her to an heir.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  These are old fond paradoxes to make\\nfools laugh i\\' th\\' alehouse. What miserable praise\\nhast thou for her that\\'s foul and foolish?\\n\\nIAGO\\n\\tThere\\'s none so foul and foolish thereunto,\\n\\tBut does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  O heavy ignorance! Thou praisest the\\nworst best. But what praise couldst thou bestow on\\na deserving woman indeed, one that in the authority\\nof her merit did justly put on the vouch of very\\nmalice itself?\\n\\nIAGO\\n\\tShe that was ever fair and never proud,\\n\\tHad tongue at will and yet was never loud,\\n\\tNever lacked gold and yet went never gay,\\n\\tFled from her wish, and yet said \"Now I may,\"\\n\\tShe that being angered, her revenge being nigh,\\n\\tBade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,\\n\\tShe that in wisdom never was so frail\\n\\tTo change the cod\\'s head for the salmon\\'s tail,\\n\\tShe that could think and ne\\'er disclose her mind,\\n\\tSee suitors following and not look behind,\\n\\tShe was a wight, if ever such wight were--\\n\\nDESDEMONA  To do what?\\n\\nIAGO\\n\\tTo suckle fools and chronicle small beer.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  O, most lame and impotent conclusion!\\n--Do not learn of him, Emilia, though he be thy\\nhusband.--How say you, Cassio? Is he not a most\\nprofane and liberal counselor?\\n\\nCASSIO  He speaks home, madam. You may relish him\\nmore in the soldier than in the scholar.\\n[Cassio takes Desdemona\\'s hand.]\\n\\nIAGO, [aside]  He takes her by the palm. Ay, well said,\\nwhisper. With as little a web as this will I ensnare as\\ngreat a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon her, do. I will\\ngyve thee in thine own courtship. You say true, \\'tis\\nso indeed. If such tricks as these strip you out of\\nyour lieutenantry, it had been better you had not\\nkissed your three fingers so oft, which now again\\nyou are most apt to play the sir in. Very good; well\\nkissed; an excellent courtesy! \\'Tis so, indeed. Yet\\nagain your fingers to your lips? Would they were\\nclyster pipes for your sake!\\t[Trumpets within.]\\nThe Moor. I know his trumpet.\\n\\nCASSIO  \\'Tis truly so.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Let\\'s meet him and receive him.\\n\\nCASSIO  Lo, where he comes!\\n\\n[Enter Othello and Attendants.]\\n\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nO, my fair warrior!\\n\\nDESDEMONA  My dear Othello!\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nIt gives me wonder great as my content\\nTo see you here before me. O my soul\\'s joy!\\nIf after every tempest come such calms,\\nMay the winds blow till they have wakened death,\\nAnd let the laboring bark climb hills of seas\\nOlympus high, and duck again as low\\nAs hell\\'s from heaven! If it were now to die,\\n\\'Twere now to be most happy, for I fear\\nMy soul hath her content so absolute\\nThat not another comfort like to this\\nSucceeds in unknown fate.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  The heavens forbid\\nBut that our loves and comforts should increase\\nEven as our days do grow!\\n\\nOTHELLO  Amen to that, sweet powers!\\nI cannot speak enough of this content.\\nIt stops me here; it is too much of joy.\\t[They kiss.]\\nAnd this, and this, the greatest discords be\\nThat e\\'er our hearts shall make!\\n\\nIAGO, [aside]  O, you are well tuned now,\\nBut I\\'ll set down the pegs that make this music,\\nAs honest as I am.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Come. Let us to the castle.--\\nNews, friends! Our wars are done. The Turks are\\ndrowned.\\nHow does my old acquaintance of this isle?--\\nHoney, you shall be well desired in Cyprus.\\nI have found great love amongst them. O, my sweet,\\nI prattle out of fashion, and I dote\\nIn mine own comforts.--I prithee, good Iago,\\nGo to the bay and disembark my coffers.\\nBring thou the master to the citadel.\\nHe is a good one, and his worthiness\\nDoes challenge much respect.--Come, Desdemona.\\nOnce more, well met at Cyprus.\\n[All but Iago and Roderigo exit.]\\n\\nIAGO, [to a departing Attendant]  Do thou meet me presently\\nat the harbor. [To Roderigo.] Come hither. If\\nthou be\\'st valiant--as they say base men being in\\nlove have then a nobility in their natures more than\\nis native to them--list me. The Lieutenant tonight\\nwatches on the court of guard. First, I must tell thee\\nthis: Desdemona is directly in love with him.\\n\\nRODERIGO  With him? Why, \\'tis not possible.\\n\\nIAGO  Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.\\nMark me with what violence she first loved the\\nMoor but for bragging and telling her fantastical\\nlies. And will she love him still for prating? Let not\\nthy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed. And\\nwhat delight shall she have to look on the devil?\\nWhen the blood is made dull with the act of sport,\\nthere should be, again to inflame it and to give\\nsatiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor, sympathy\\nin years, manners, and beauties, all which the Moor\\nis defective in. Now, for want of these required\\nconveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself\\nabused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and\\nabhor the Moor. Very nature will instruct her in it\\nand compel her to some second choice. Now, sir,\\nthis granted--as it is a most pregnant and unforced\\nposition--who stands so eminent in the degree of\\nthis fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble, no\\nfurther conscionable than in putting on the mere\\nform of civil and humane seeming for the better\\ncompassing of his salt and most hidden loose\\naffection. Why, none, why, none! A slipper and\\nsubtle knave, a finder-out of occasions, that has an\\neye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though\\ntrue advantage never present itself; a devilish knave!\\nBesides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all\\nthose requisites in him that folly and green minds\\nlook after. A pestilent complete knave, and the\\nwoman hath found him already.\\n\\nRODERIGO  I cannot believe that in her. She\\'s full of\\nmost blessed condition.\\n\\nIAGO  Blessed fig\\'s end! The wine she drinks is made of\\ngrapes. If she had been blessed, she would never\\nhave loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou\\nnot see her paddle with the palm of his hand? Didst\\nnot mark that?\\n\\nRODERIGO  Yes, that I did. But that was but courtesy.\\n\\nIAGO  Lechery, by this hand! An index and obscure\\nprologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts.\\nThey met so near with their lips that their breaths\\nembraced together. Villainous thoughts, Roderigo!\\nWhen these mutualities so marshal the way, hard\\nat hand comes the master and main exercise, th\\'\\nincorporate conclusion. Pish! But, sir, be you ruled\\nby me. I have brought you from Venice. Watch you\\ntonight. For the command, I\\'ll lay \\'t upon you.\\nCassio knows you not. I\\'ll not be far from you. Do\\nyou find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by\\nspeaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from\\nwhat other course you please, which the time shall\\nmore favorably minister.\\n\\nRODERIGO  Well.\\n\\nIAGO  Sir, he\\'s rash and very sudden in choler, and\\nhaply may strike at you. Provoke him that he may,\\nfor even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to\\nmutiny, whose qualification shall come into no\\ntrue taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So\\nshall you have a shorter journey to your desires by\\nthe means I shall then have to prefer them, and the\\nimpediment most profitably removed, without the\\nwhich there were no expectation of our prosperity.\\n\\nRODERIGO  I will do this, if you can bring it to any\\nopportunity.\\n\\nIAGO  I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel. I\\nmust fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.\\n\\nRODERIGO  Adieu.\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nIAGO\\nThat Cassio loves her, I do well believe \\'t.\\nThat she loves him, \\'tis apt and of great credit.\\nThe Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,\\nIs of a constant, loving, noble nature,\\nAnd I dare think he\\'ll prove to Desdemona\\nA most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,\\nNot out of absolute lust (though peradventure\\nI stand accountant for as great a sin)\\nBut partly led to diet my revenge\\nFor that I do suspect the lusty Moor\\nHath leaped into my seat--the thought whereof\\nDoth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards,\\nAnd nothing can or shall content my soul\\nTill I am evened with him, wife for wife,\\nOr, failing so, yet that I put the Moor\\nAt least into a jealousy so strong\\nThat judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,\\nIf this poor trash of Venice, whom I trace\\nFor his quick hunting, stand the putting on,\\nI\\'ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,\\nAbuse him to the Moor in the rank garb\\n(For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too),\\nMake the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me\\nFor making him egregiously an ass\\nAnd practicing upon his peace and quiet\\nEven to madness. \\'Tis here, but yet confused.\\nKnavery\\'s plain face is never seen till used.\\n[He exits.]\\n\\nScene 2\\n=======\\n[Enter Othello\\'s Herald with a proclamation.]\\n\\n\\nHERALD  It is Othello\\'s pleasure, our noble and valiant\\ngeneral, that upon certain tidings now arrived,\\nimporting the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet,\\nevery man put himself into triumph: some to\\ndance, some to make bonfires, each man to what\\nsport and revels his addition leads him. For besides\\nthese beneficial news, it is the celebration of his\\nnuptial. So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed\\nAll offices are open, and there is full\\nliberty of feasting from this present hour of five till\\nthe bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the isle of\\nCyprus and our noble general, Othello!\\n[He exits.]\\n\\nScene 3\\n=======\\n[Enter Othello, Desdemona, Cassio, and Attendants.]\\n\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nGood Michael, look you to the guard tonight.\\nLet\\'s teach ourselves that honorable stop\\nNot to outsport discretion.\\n\\nCASSIO\\nIago hath direction what to do,\\nBut notwithstanding, with my personal eye\\nWill I look to \\'t.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Iago is most honest.\\nMichael, goodnight. Tomorrow with your earliest\\nLet me have speech with you. [To Desdemona.] Come,\\nmy dear love,\\nThe purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;\\nThat profit\\'s yet to come \\'tween me and you.--\\nGoodnight.\\n[Othello and Desdemona exit, with Attendants.]\\n\\n[Enter Iago.]\\n\\n\\nCASSIO\\nWelcome, Iago. We must to the watch.\\n\\nIAGO  Not this hour, lieutenant. \\'Tis not yet ten o\\' th\\'\\nclock. Our general cast us thus early for the love of\\nhis Desdemona--who let us not therefore blame;\\nhe hath not yet made wanton the night with her, and\\nshe is sport for Jove.\\n\\nCASSIO  She\\'s a most exquisite lady.\\n\\nIAGO  And, I\\'ll warrant her, full of game.\\n\\nCASSIO  Indeed, she\\'s a most fresh and delicate\\ncreature.\\n\\nIAGO  What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley\\nto provocation.\\n\\nCASSIO  An inviting eye, and yet methinks right\\nmodest.\\n\\nIAGO  And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?\\n\\nCASSIO  She is indeed perfection.\\n\\nIAGO  Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant,\\nI have a stoup of wine; and here without are a\\nbrace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a\\nmeasure to the health of black Othello.\\n\\nCASSIO  Not tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and\\nunhappy brains for drinking. I could well wish\\ncourtesy would invent some other custom of\\nentertainment.\\n\\nIAGO  O, they are our friends! But one cup; I\\'ll drink\\nfor you.\\n\\nCASSIO  I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was\\ncraftily qualified too, and behold what innovation it\\nmakes here. I am unfortunate in the infirmity and\\ndare not task my weakness with any more.\\n\\nIAGO  What, man! \\'Tis a night of revels. The gallants\\ndesire it.\\n\\nCASSIO  Where are they?\\n\\nIAGO  Here at the door. I pray you, call them in.\\n\\nCASSIO  I\\'ll do \\'t, but it dislikes me.\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nIAGO\\nIf I can fasten but one cup upon him\\nWith that which he hath drunk tonight already,\\nHe\\'ll be as full of quarrel and offense\\nAs my young mistress\\' dog. Now my sick fool\\nRoderigo,\\nWhom love hath turned almost the wrong side out,\\nTo Desdemona hath tonight caroused\\nPotations pottle-deep; and he\\'s to watch.\\nThree else of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits\\nThat hold their honors in a wary distance,\\nThe very elements of this warlike isle,\\nHave I tonight flustered with flowing cups;\\nAnd they watch too. Now, \\'mongst this flock of\\ndrunkards\\nAm I to put our Cassio in some action\\nThat may offend the isle. But here they come.\\nIf consequence do but approve my dream,\\nMy boat sails freely both with wind and stream.\\n\\n[Enter Cassio, Montano, and Gentlemen, followed by\\nServants with wine.]\\n\\n\\nCASSIO  \\'Fore God, they have given me a rouse\\nalready.\\n\\nMONTANO  Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I\\nam a soldier.\\n\\nIAGO  Some wine, ho!\\n[Sings.]\\tAnd let me the cannikin clink, clink,\\n\\tAnd let me the cannikin clink.\\n\\t   A soldier\\'s a man,\\n\\t   O, man\\'s life\\'s but a span,\\n\\tWhy, then, let a soldier drink.\\nSome wine, boys!\\n\\nCASSIO  \\'Fore God, an excellent song.\\n\\nIAGO  I learned it in England, where indeed they are\\nmost potent in potting. Your Dane, your German,\\nand your swag-bellied Hollander--drink, ho!--are\\nnothing to your English.\\n\\nCASSIO  Is your Englishman so exquisite in his\\ndrinking?\\n\\nIAGO  Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane\\ndead drunk. He sweats not to overthrow your Almain.\\nHe gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next\\npottle can be filled.\\n\\nCASSIO  To the health of our general!\\n\\nMONTANO  I am for it, lieutenant, and I\\'ll do you\\njustice.\\n\\nIAGO  O sweet England!\\n[Sings.]\\tKing Stephen was and-a worthy peer,\\n\\t   His breeches cost him but a crown;\\n\\tHe held them sixpence all too dear;\\n\\t   With that he called the tailor lown.\\n\\tHe was a wight of high renown,\\n\\t   And thou art but of low degree;\\n\\t\\'Tis pride that pulls the country down,\\n\\t   Then take thy auld cloak about thee.\\nSome wine, ho!\\n\\nCASSIO  \\'Fore God, this is a more exquisite song than\\nthe other!\\n\\nIAGO  Will you hear \\'t again?\\n\\nCASSIO  No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place\\nthat does those things. Well, God\\'s above all; and\\nthere be souls must be saved, and there be souls\\nmust not be saved.\\n\\nIAGO  It\\'s true, good lieutenant.\\n\\nCASSIO  For mine own part--no offense to the General,\\nnor any man of quality--I hope to be saved.\\n\\nIAGO  And so do I too, lieutenant.\\n\\nCASSIO  Ay, but, by your leave, not before me. The\\nLieutenant is to be saved before the Ancient. Let\\'s\\nhave no more of this. Let\\'s to our affairs. God\\nforgive us our sins! Gentlemen, let\\'s look to our\\nbusiness. Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk. This\\nis my ancient, this is my right hand, and this is my\\nleft. I am not drunk now. I can stand well enough,\\nand I speak well enough.\\n\\nGENTLEMEN  Excellent well.\\n\\nCASSIO  Why, very well then. You must not think then\\nthat I am drunk.\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nMONTANO\\nTo th\\' platform, masters. Come, let\\'s set the watch.\\n[Gentlemen exit.]\\n\\nIAGO, [to Montano]\\nYou see this fellow that is gone before?\\nHe\\'s a soldier fit to stand by Caesar\\nAnd give direction; and do but see his vice.\\n\\'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,\\nThe one as long as th\\' other. \\'Tis pity of him.\\nI fear the trust Othello puts him in,\\nOn some odd time of his infirmity,\\nWill shake this island.\\n\\nMONTANO  But is he often thus?\\n\\nIAGO\\n\\'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep.\\nHe\\'ll watch the horologe a double set\\nIf drink rock not his cradle.\\n\\nMONTANO  It were well\\nThe General were put in mind of it.\\nPerhaps he sees it not, or his good nature\\nPrizes the virtue that appears in Cassio\\nAnd looks not on his evils. Is not this true?\\n\\n[Enter Roderigo.]\\n\\n\\nIAGO, [aside to Roderigo]  How now, Roderigo?\\nI pray you, after the Lieutenant, go.\\n[Roderigo exits.]\\n\\nMONTANO\\nAnd \\'tis great pity that the noble Moor\\nShould hazard such a place as his own second\\nWith one of an engraffed infirmity.\\nIt were an honest action to say so\\nTo the Moor.\\n\\nIAGO  Not I, for this fair island.\\nI do love Cassio well and would do much\\nTo cure him of this evil--\\t[\"Help, help!\" within.]\\nBut hark! What noise?\\n\\n[Enter Cassio, pursuing Roderigo.]\\n\\n\\nCASSIO  Zounds, you rogue, you rascal!\\n\\nMONTANO  What\\'s the matter, lieutenant?\\n\\nCASSIO  A knave teach me my duty? I\\'ll beat the knave\\ninto a twiggen bottle.\\n\\nRODERIGO  Beat me?\\n\\nCASSIO  Dost thou prate, rogue?\\t[He hits Roderigo.]\\n\\nMONTANO  Nay, good lieutenant. I pray you, sir, hold\\nyour hand.\\n\\nCASSIO  Let me go, sir, or I\\'ll knock you o\\'er the\\nmazard.\\n\\nMONTANO  Come, come, you\\'re drunk.\\n\\nCASSIO  Drunk?\\n[They fight.]\\n\\nIAGO, [aside to Roderigo]\\nAway, I say! Go out and cry a mutiny.\\n[Roderigo exits.]\\nNay, good lieutenant.--God\\'s will, gentlemen!--\\nHelp, ho! Lieutenant--sir--Montano--sir--\\nHelp, masters!--Here\\'s a goodly watch indeed!\\n[A bell is rung.]\\nWho\\'s that which rings the bell? Diablo, ho!\\nThe town will rise. God\\'s will, lieutenant, hold!\\nYou will be shamed forever.\\n\\n[Enter Othello and Attendants.]\\n\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nWhat is the matter here?\\n\\nMONTANO  Zounds, I bleed\\nstill.\\nI am hurt to th\\' death. He dies!\\t[He attacks Cassio.]\\n\\nOTHELLO  Hold, for your lives!\\n\\nIAGO\\nHold, ho! Lieutenant--sir--Montano--\\ngentlemen--\\nHave you forgot all sense of place and duty?\\nHold! The General speaks to you. Hold, for shame!\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nWhy, how now, ho! From whence ariseth this?\\nAre we turned Turks, and to ourselves do that\\nWhich heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?\\nFor Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl!\\nHe that stirs next to carve for his own rage\\nHolds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.\\nSilence that dreadful bell. It frights the isle\\nFrom her propriety. What is the matter, masters?\\nHonest Iago, that looks dead with grieving,\\nSpeak. Who began this? On thy love, I charge thee.\\n\\nIAGO\\nI do not know. Friends all but now, even now,\\nIn quarter and in terms like bride and groom\\nDivesting them for bed; and then but now,\\nAs if some planet had unwitted men,\\nSwords out, and tilting one at other\\'s breast,\\nIn opposition bloody. I cannot speak\\nAny beginning to this peevish odds,\\nAnd would in action glorious I had lost\\nThose legs that brought me to a part of it!\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nHow comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?\\n\\nCASSIO\\nI pray you pardon me; I cannot speak.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nWorthy Montano, you were wont be civil.\\nThe gravity and stillness of your youth\\nThe world hath noted. And your name is great\\nIn mouths of wisest censure. What\\'s the matter\\nThat you unlace your reputation thus,\\nAnd spend your rich opinion for the name\\nOf a night-brawler? Give me answer to it.\\n\\nMONTANO\\nWorthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.\\nYour officer Iago can inform you,\\nWhile I spare speech, which something now offends\\nme,\\nOf all that I do know; nor know I aught\\nBy me that\\'s said or done amiss this night,\\nUnless self-charity be sometimes a vice,\\nAnd to defend ourselves it be a sin\\nWhen violence assails us.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Now, by heaven,\\nMy blood begins my safer guides to rule,\\nAnd passion, having my best judgment collied,\\nAssays to lead the way. Zounds, if I stir,\\nOr do but lift this arm, the best of you\\nShall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know\\nHow this foul rout began, who set it on;\\nAnd he that is approved in this offense,\\nThough he had twinned with me, both at a birth,\\nShall lose me. What, in a town of war\\nYet wild, the people\\'s hearts brimful of fear,\\nTo manage private and domestic quarrel,\\nIn night, and on the court and guard of safety?\\n\\'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began \\'t?\\n\\nMONTANO\\nIf partially affined, or leagued in office,\\nThou dost deliver more or less than truth,\\nThou art no soldier.\\n\\nIAGO  Touch me not so near.\\nI had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth\\nThan it should do offense to Michael Cassio.\\nYet I persuade myself, to speak the truth\\nShall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general:\\nMontano and myself being in speech,\\nThere comes a fellow crying out for help,\\nAnd Cassio following him with determined sword\\nTo execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman\\n[Pointing to Montano.]\\nSteps in to Cassio and entreats his pause.\\nMyself the crying fellow did pursue,\\nLest by his clamor--as it so fell out--\\nThe town might fall in fright. He, swift of foot,\\nOutran my purpose, and I returned the rather\\nFor that I heard the clink and fall of swords\\nAnd Cassio high in oath, which till tonight\\nI ne\\'er might say before. When I came back--\\nFor this was brief--I found them close together\\nAt blow and thrust, even as again they were\\nWhen you yourself did part them.\\nMore of this matter cannot I report.\\nBut men are men; the best sometimes forget.\\nThough Cassio did some little wrong to him,\\nAs men in rage strike those that wish them best,\\nYet surely Cassio, I believe, received\\nFrom him that fled some strange indignity\\nWhich patience could not pass.\\n\\nOTHELLO  I know, Iago,\\nThy honesty and love doth mince this matter,\\nMaking it light to Cassio.--Cassio, I love thee,\\nBut nevermore be officer of mine.\\n\\n[Enter Desdemona attended.]\\n\\nLook if my gentle love be not raised up!\\nI\\'ll make thee an example.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nWhat is the matter, dear?\\n\\nOTHELLO  All\\'s well now,\\nsweeting.\\nCome away to bed. [To Montano.] Sir, for your hurts,\\nMyself will be your surgeon.--Lead him off.\\n[Montano is led off.]\\nIago, look with care about the town\\nAnd silence those whom this vile brawl\\ndistracted.--\\nCome, Desdemona. \\'Tis the soldier\\'s life\\nTo have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.\\n[All but Iago and Cassio exit.]\\n\\nIAGO  What, are you hurt, lieutenant?\\n\\nCASSIO  Ay, past all surgery.\\n\\nIAGO  Marry, God forbid!\\n\\nCASSIO  Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have\\nlost my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of\\nmyself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,\\nIago, my reputation!\\n\\nIAGO  As I am an honest man, I thought you had\\nreceived some bodily wound. There is more sense\\nin that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and\\nmost false imposition, oft got without merit and lost\\nwithout deserving. You have lost no reputation at\\nall, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What,\\nman, there are ways to recover the General again!\\nYou are but now cast in his mood--a punishment\\nmore in policy than in malice, even so as one would\\nbeat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious\\nlion. Sue to him again and he\\'s yours.\\n\\nCASSIO  I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive\\nso good a commander with so slight, so drunken,\\nand so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? And speak\\nparrot? And squabble? Swagger? Swear? And discourse\\nfustian with one\\'s own shadow? O thou\\ninvisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be\\nknown by, let us call thee devil!\\n\\nIAGO  What was he that you followed with your sword?\\nWhat had he done to you?\\n\\nCASSIO  I know not.\\n\\nIAGO  Is \\'t possible?\\n\\nCASSIO  I remember a mass of things, but nothing\\ndistinctly; a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O\\nGod, that men should put an enemy in their\\nmouths to steal away their brains! That we should\\nwith joy, pleasance, revel, and applause transform\\nourselves into beasts!\\n\\nIAGO  Why, but you are now well enough. How came\\nyou thus recovered?\\n\\nCASSIO  It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give\\nplace to the devil wrath. One unperfectness shows\\nme another, to make me frankly despise myself.\\n\\nIAGO  Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time,\\nthe place, and the condition of this country stands,\\nI could heartily wish this had not so befallen. But\\nsince it is as it is, mend it for your own good.\\n\\nCASSIO  I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell\\nme I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as\\nHydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be\\nnow a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently\\na beast! O, strange! Every inordinate cup is unblessed,\\nand the ingredient is a devil.\\n\\nIAGO  Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,\\nif it be well used. Exclaim no more against it.\\nAnd, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.\\n\\nCASSIO  I have well approved it, sir.--I drunk!\\n\\nIAGO  You or any man living may be drunk at a time,\\nman. I\\'ll tell you what you shall do. Our general\\'s\\nwife is now the general: I may say so in this\\nrespect, for that he hath devoted and given up\\nhimself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement\\nof her parts and graces. Confess yourself\\nfreely to her. Importune her help to put you in your\\nplace again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so\\nblessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her\\ngoodness not to do more than she is requested. This\\nbroken joint between you and her husband entreat\\nher to splinter, and, my fortunes against any lay\\nworth naming, this crack of your love shall grow\\nstronger than it was before.\\n\\nCASSIO  You advise me well.\\n\\nIAGO  I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest\\nkindness.\\n\\nCASSIO  I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I\\nwill beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake\\nfor me. I am desperate of my fortunes if they check\\nme here.\\n\\nIAGO  You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant. I\\nmust to the watch.\\n\\nCASSIO  Good night, honest Iago.\\t[Cassio exits.]\\n\\nIAGO\\nAnd what\\'s he, then, that says I play the villain,\\nWhen this advice is free I give and honest,\\nProbal to thinking, and indeed the course\\nTo win the Moor again? For \\'tis most easy\\nTh\\' inclining Desdemona to subdue\\nIn any honest suit. She\\'s framed as fruitful\\nAs the free elements. And then for her\\nTo win the Moor--were \\'t to renounce his baptism,\\nAll seals and symbols of redeemed sin--\\nHis soul is so enfettered to her love\\nThat she may make, unmake, do what she list,\\nEven as her appetite shall play the god\\nWith his weak function. How am I then a villain\\nTo counsel Cassio to this parallel course\\nDirectly to his good? Divinity of hell!\\nWhen devils will the blackest sins put on,\\nThey do suggest at first with heavenly shows,\\nAs I do now. For whiles this honest fool\\nPlies Desdemona to repair his fortune,\\nAnd she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,\\nI\\'ll pour this pestilence into his ear:\\nThat she repeals him for her body\\'s lust;\\nAnd by how much she strives to do him good,\\nShe shall undo her credit with the Moor.\\nSo will I turn her virtue into pitch,\\nAnd out of her own goodness make the net\\nThat shall enmesh them all.\\n\\n[Enter Roderigo.]\\n\\nHow now, Roderigo?\\n\\nRODERIGO  I do follow here in the chase, not like a\\nhound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My\\nmoney is almost spent, I have been tonight exceedingly\\nwell cudgeled, and I think the issue will be I\\nshall have so much experience for my pains, and so,\\nwith no money at all and a little more wit, return\\nagain to Venice.\\n\\nIAGO\\nHow poor are they that have not patience!\\nWhat wound did ever heal but by degrees?\\nThou know\\'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,\\nAnd wit depends on dilatory time.\\nDoes \\'t not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,\\nAnd thou, by that small hurt, hast cashiered Cassio.\\nThough other things grow fair against the sun,\\nYet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.\\nContent thyself awhile. By th\\' Mass, \\'tis morning!\\nPleasure and action make the hours seem short.\\nRetire thee; go where thou art billeted.\\nAway, I say! Thou shalt know more hereafter.\\nNay, get thee gone.\\t[Roderigo exits.]\\nTwo things are to be done.\\nMy wife must move for Cassio to her mistress.\\nI\\'ll set her on.\\nMyself the while to draw the Moor apart\\nAnd bring him jump when he may Cassio find\\nSoliciting his wife. Ay, that\\'s the way.\\nDull not device by coldness and delay.\\n[He exits.]\\n\\n\\nACT 3\\n=====\\n\\nScene 1\\n=======\\n[Enter Cassio with Musicians.]\\n\\n\\nCASSIO\\nMasters, play here (I will content your pains)\\nSomething that\\'s brief; and bid \"Good morrow,\\ngeneral.\"\\t[They play.]\\n\\n[Enter the Clown.]\\n\\n\\nCLOWN  Why masters, have your instruments been in\\nNaples, that they speak i\\' th\\' nose thus?\\n\\nMUSICIAN  How, sir, how?\\n\\nCLOWN  Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?\\n\\nMUSICIAN  Ay, marry, are they, sir.\\n\\nCLOWN  O, thereby hangs a tail.\\n\\nMUSICIAN  Whereby hangs a tale, sir?\\n\\nCLOWN  Marry, sir, by many a wind instrument that I\\nknow. But, masters, here\\'s money for you; and the\\nGeneral so likes your music that he desires you, for\\nlove\\'s sake, to make no more noise with it.\\n\\nMUSICIAN  Well, sir, we will not.\\n\\nCLOWN  If you have any music that may not be heard, to\\n\\'t again. But, as they say, to hear music the General\\ndoes not greatly care.\\n\\nMUSICIAN  We have none such, sir.\\n\\nCLOWN  Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I\\'ll\\naway. Go, vanish into air, away!\\n\\n[Musicians exit.]\\n\\nCASSIO  Dost thou hear, mine honest friend?\\n\\nCLOWN  No, I hear not your honest friend. I hear you.\\n\\nCASSIO  Prithee, keep up thy quillets.\\t[Giving money.]\\nThere\\'s a poor piece of gold for thee. If the gentlewoman\\nthat attends the General\\'s wife be stirring,\\ntell her there\\'s one Cassio entreats her a little favor\\nof speech. Wilt thou do this?\\n\\nCLOWN  She is stirring, sir. If she will stir hither, I shall\\nseem to notify unto her.\\n\\nCASSIO\\nDo, good my friend.\\t[Clown exits.]\\n\\n[Enter Iago.]\\n\\nIn happy time, Iago.\\n\\nIAGO  You have not been abed, then?\\n\\nCASSIO  Why, no. The day had broke\\nBefore we parted. I have made bold, Iago,\\nTo send in to your wife. My suit to her\\nIs that she will to virtuous Desdemona\\nProcure me some access.\\n\\nIAGO  I\\'ll send her to you presently,\\nAnd I\\'ll devise a mean to draw the Moor\\nOut of the way, that your converse and business\\nMay be more free.\\n\\nCASSIO\\nI humbly thank you for \\'t. [Iago exits.] I never\\nknew\\nA Florentine more kind and honest.\\n\\n[Enter Emilia.]\\n\\n\\nEMILIA\\nGood morrow, good lieutenant. I am sorry\\nFor your displeasure, but all will sure be well.\\nThe General and his wife are talking of it,\\nAnd she speaks for you stoutly. The Moor replies\\nThat he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus\\nAnd great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom\\nHe might not but refuse you. But he protests he\\nloves you\\nAnd needs no other suitor but his likings\\nTo take the safest occasion by the front\\nTo bring you in again.\\n\\nCASSIO  Yet I beseech you,\\nIf you think fit, or that it may be done,\\nGive me advantage of some brief discourse\\nWith Desdemon alone.\\n\\nEMILIA  Pray you come in.\\nI will bestow you where you shall have time\\nTo speak your bosom freely.\\n\\nCASSIO  I am much bound to you.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 2\\n=======\\n[Enter Othello, Iago, and Gentlemen.]\\n\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nThese letters give, Iago, to the pilot\\nAnd by him do my duties to the Senate.\\n[He gives Iago some papers.]\\nThat done, I will be walking on the works.\\nRepair there to me.\\n\\nIAGO  Well, my good lord, I\\'ll do \\'t.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nThis fortification, gentlemen, shall we see \\'t?\\n\\nGENTLEMEN\\nWe wait upon your Lordship.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 3\\n=======\\n[Enter Desdemona, Cassio, and Emilia.]\\n\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nBe thou assured, good Cassio, I will do\\nAll my abilities in thy behalf.\\n\\nEMILIA\\nGood madam, do. I warrant it grieves my husband\\nAs if the cause were his.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nO, that\\'s an honest fellow! Do not doubt, Cassio,\\nBut I will have my lord and you again\\nAs friendly as you were.\\n\\nCASSIO  Bounteous madam,\\nWhatever shall become of Michael Cassio,\\nHe\\'s never anything but your true servant.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nI know \\'t. I thank you. You do love my lord;\\nYou have known him long; and be you well assured\\nHe shall in strangeness stand no farther off\\nThan in a politic distance.\\n\\nCASSIO  Ay, but, lady,\\nThat policy may either last so long,\\nOr feed upon such nice and waterish diet,\\nOr breed itself so out of circumstance,\\nThat, I being absent and my place supplied,\\nMy general will forget my love and service.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nDo not doubt that. Before Emilia here,\\nI give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,\\nIf I do vow a friendship, I\\'ll perform it\\nTo the last article. My lord shall never rest:\\nI\\'ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;\\nHis bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;\\nI\\'ll intermingle everything he does\\nWith Cassio\\'s suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio,\\nFor thy solicitor shall rather die\\nThan give thy cause away.\\n\\n[Enter Othello and Iago.]\\n\\n\\nEMILIA  Madam, here comes my lord.\\n\\nCASSIO  Madam, I\\'ll take my leave.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Why, stay, and hear me speak.\\n\\nCASSIO\\nMadam, not now. I am very ill at ease,\\nUnfit for mine own purposes.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Well, do your discretion.\\t[Cassio exits.]\\n\\nIAGO\\nHa, I like not that.\\n\\nOTHELLO  What dost thou say?\\n\\nIAGO\\nNothing, my lord; or if--I know not what.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nWas not that Cassio parted from my wife?\\n\\nIAGO\\nCassio, my lord? No, sure, I cannot think it\\nThat he would steal away so guiltylike,\\nSeeing your coming.\\n\\nOTHELLO  I do believe \\'twas he.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  How now, my lord?\\nI have been talking with a suitor here,\\nA man that languishes in your displeasure.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Who is \\'t you mean?\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nWhy, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,\\nIf I have any grace or power to move you,\\nHis present reconciliation take;\\nFor if he be not one that truly loves you,\\nThat errs in ignorance and not in cunning,\\nI have no judgment in an honest face.\\nI prithee call him back.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Went he hence now?\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Yes, faith, so humbled\\nThat he hath left part of his grief with me\\nTo suffer with him. Good love, call him back.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nNot now, sweet Desdemon. Some other time.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nBut shall \\'t be shortly?\\n\\nOTHELLO  The sooner, sweet, for you.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nShall \\'t be tonight at supper?\\n\\nOTHELLO  No, not tonight.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Tomorrow dinner, then?\\n\\nOTHELLO  I shall not dine at home;\\nI meet the captains at the citadel.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nWhy then tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn,\\nOn Tuesday noon or night; on Wednesday morn.\\nI prithee name the time, but let it not\\nExceed three days. In faith, he\\'s penitent;\\nAnd yet his trespass, in our common reason--\\nSave that, they say, the wars must make example\\nOut of her best--is not almost a fault\\nT\\' incur a private check. When shall he come?\\nTell me, Othello. I wonder in my soul\\nWhat you would ask me that I should deny,\\nOr stand so mamm\\'ring on? What? Michael Cassio,\\nThat came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,\\nWhen I have spoke of you dispraisingly,\\nHath ta\\'en your part--to have so much to do\\nTo bring him in! By \\'r Lady, I could do much--\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nPrithee, no more. Let him come when he will;\\nI will deny thee nothing.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Why, this is not a boon!\\n\\'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,\\nOr feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,\\nOr sue to you to do a peculiar profit\\nTo your own person. Nay, when I have a suit\\nWherein I mean to touch your love indeed,\\nIt shall be full of poise and difficult weight,\\nAnd fearful to be granted.\\n\\nOTHELLO  I will deny thee nothing!\\nWhereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,\\nTo leave me but a little to myself.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nShall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nFarewell, my Desdemona. I\\'ll come to thee straight.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nEmilia, come.--Be as your fancies teach you.\\nWhate\\'er you be, I am obedient.\\n[Desdemona and Emilia exit.]\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nExcellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul\\nBut I do love thee! And when I love thee not,\\nChaos is come again.\\n\\nIAGO  My noble lord--\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nWhat dost thou say, Iago?\\n\\nIAGO  Did Michael Cassio,\\nWhen you wooed my lady, know of your love?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nHe did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?\\n\\nIAGO\\nBut for a satisfaction of my thought,\\nNo further harm.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Why of thy thought, Iago?\\n\\nIAGO\\nI did not think he had been acquainted with her.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nO yes, and went between us very oft.\\n\\nIAGO  Indeed?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nIndeed? Ay, indeed! Discern\\'st thou aught in that?\\nIs he not honest?\\n\\nIAGO  Honest, my lord?\\n\\nOTHELLO  Honest--ay, honest.\\n\\nIAGO\\nMy lord, for aught I know.\\n\\nOTHELLO  What dost thou think?\\n\\nIAGO  Think, my lord?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\n\"Think, my lord?\" By heaven, thou echo\\'st me\\nAs if there were some monster in thy thought\\nToo hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean\\nsomething.\\nI heard thee say even now, thou lik\\'st not that,\\nWhen Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?\\nAnd when I told thee he was of my counsel\\nIn my whole course of wooing, thou cried\\'st\\n\"Indeed?\"\\nAnd didst contract and purse thy brow together\\nAs if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain\\nSome horrible conceit. If thou dost love me,\\nShow me thy thought.\\n\\nIAGO  My lord, you know I love you.\\n\\nOTHELLO  I think thou dost;\\nAnd for I know thou \\'rt full of love and honesty\\nAnd weigh\\'st thy words before thou giv\\'st them\\nbreath,\\nTherefore these stops of thine fright me the more.\\nFor such things in a false, disloyal knave\\nAre tricks of custom; but in a man that\\'s just,\\nThey\\'re close dilations working from the heart\\nThat passion cannot rule.\\n\\nIAGO  For Michael Cassio,\\nI dare be sworn I think that he is honest.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nI think so too.\\n\\nIAGO  Men should be what they seem;\\nOr those that be not, would they might seem none!\\n\\nOTHELLO  Certain, men should be what they seem.\\n\\nIAGO\\nWhy then, I think Cassio\\'s an honest man.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Nay, yet there\\'s more in this.\\nI prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings,\\nAs thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of\\nthoughts\\nThe worst of words.\\n\\nIAGO  Good my lord, pardon me.\\nThough I am bound to every act of duty,\\nI am not bound to that all slaves are free to.\\nUtter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and\\nfalse--\\nAs where\\'s that palace whereinto foul things\\nSometimes intrude not? Who has that breast so\\npure\\nBut some uncleanly apprehensions\\nKeep leets and law days and in sessions sit\\nWith meditations lawful?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nThou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,\\nIf thou but think\\'st him wronged and mak\\'st his ear\\nA stranger to thy thoughts.\\n\\nIAGO  I do beseech you,\\nThough I perchance am vicious in my guess--\\nAs, I confess, it is my nature\\'s plague\\nTo spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy\\nShapes faults that are not--that your wisdom\\nFrom one that so imperfectly conceits\\nWould take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble\\nOut of his scattering and unsure observance.\\nIt were not for your quiet nor your good,\\nNor for my manhood, honesty, and wisdom,\\nTo let you know my thoughts.\\n\\nOTHELLO  What dost thou mean?\\n\\nIAGO\\nGood name in man and woman, dear my lord,\\nIs the immediate jewel of their souls.\\nWho steals my purse steals trash. \\'Tis something,\\nnothing;\\n\\'Twas mine, \\'tis his, and has been slave to\\nthousands.\\nBut he that filches from me my good name\\nRobs me of that which not enriches him\\nAnd makes me poor indeed.\\n\\nOTHELLO  By heaven, I\\'ll know thy thoughts.\\n\\nIAGO\\nYou cannot, if my heart were in your hand,\\nNor shall not, whilst \\'tis in my custody.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nHa?\\n\\nIAGO  O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!\\nIt is the green-eyed monster which doth mock\\nThe meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss\\nWho, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;\\nBut O, what damned minutes tells he o\\'er\\nWho dotes, yet doubts; suspects, yet strongly loves!\\n\\nOTHELLO  O misery!\\n\\nIAGO\\nPoor and content is rich, and rich enough;\\nBut riches fineless is as poor as winter\\nTo him that ever fears he shall be poor.\\nGood God, the souls of all my tribe defend\\nFrom jealousy!\\n\\nOTHELLO  Why, why is this?\\nThink\\'st thou I\\'d make a life of jealousy,\\nTo follow still the changes of the moon\\nWith fresh suspicions? No. To be once in doubt\\nIs once to be resolved. Exchange me for a goat\\nWhen I shall turn the business of my soul\\nTo such exsufflicate and blown surmises,\\nMatching thy inference. \\'Tis not to make me jealous\\nTo say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,\\nIs free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well.\\nWhere virtue is, these are more virtuous.\\nNor from mine own weak merits will I draw\\nThe smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,\\nFor she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,\\nI\\'ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;\\nAnd on the proof, there is no more but this:\\nAway at once with love or jealousy.\\n\\nIAGO\\nI am glad of this, for now I shall have reason\\nTo show the love and duty that I bear you\\nWith franker spirit. Therefore, as I am bound,\\nReceive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.\\nLook to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;\\nWear your eyes thus, not jealous nor secure.\\nI would not have your free and noble nature,\\nOut of self-bounty, be abused. Look to \\'t.\\nI know our country disposition well.\\nIn Venice they do let God see the pranks\\nThey dare not show their husbands. Their best\\nconscience\\nIs not to leave \\'t undone, but keep \\'t unknown.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Dost thou say so?\\n\\nIAGO\\nShe did deceive her father, marrying you,\\nAnd when she seemed to shake and fear your looks,\\nShe loved them most.\\n\\nOTHELLO  And so she did.\\n\\nIAGO  Why, go to, then!\\nShe that, so young, could give out such a seeming,\\nTo seel her father\\'s eyes up close as oak,\\nHe thought \\'twas witchcraft! But I am much to\\nblame.\\nI humbly do beseech you of your pardon\\nFor too much loving you.\\n\\nOTHELLO  I am bound to thee forever.\\n\\nIAGO\\nI see this hath a little dashed your spirits.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nNot a jot, not a jot.\\n\\nIAGO  I\\' faith, I fear it has.\\nI hope you will consider what is spoke\\nComes from my love. But I do see you\\'re moved.\\nI am to pray you not to strain my speech\\nTo grosser issues nor to larger reach\\nThan to suspicion.\\n\\nOTHELLO  I will not.\\n\\nIAGO  Should you do so, my lord,\\nMy speech should fall into such vile success\\nAs my thoughts aim not at. Cassio\\'s my worthy\\nfriend.\\nMy lord, I see you\\'re moved.\\n\\nOTHELLO  No, not much moved.\\nI do not think but Desdemona\\'s honest.\\n\\nIAGO\\nLong live she so! And long live you to think so!\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nAnd yet, how nature erring from itself--\\n\\nIAGO\\nAy, there\\'s the point. As, to be bold with you,\\nNot to affect many proposed matches\\nOf her own clime, complexion, and degree,\\nWhereto we see in all things nature tends--\\nFoh! One may smell in such a will most rank,\\nFoul disproportion, thoughts unnatural--\\nBut pardon me--I do not in position\\nDistinctly speak of her, though I may fear\\nHer will, recoiling to her better judgment,\\nMay fall to match you with her country forms\\nAnd happily repent.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Farewell, farewell!\\nIf more thou dost perceive, let me know more.\\nSet on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.\\n\\nIAGO, [beginning to exit]  My lord, I take my leave.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nWhy did I marry? This honest creature doubtless\\nSees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.\\n\\nIAGO, [returning]\\nMy lord, I would I might entreat your Honor\\nTo scan this thing no farther. Leave it to time.\\nAlthough \\'tis fit that Cassio have his place--\\nFor sure he fills it up with great ability--\\nYet, if you please to hold him off awhile,\\nYou shall by that perceive him and his means.\\nNote if your lady strain his entertainment\\nWith any strong or vehement importunity.\\nMuch will be seen in that. In the meantime,\\nLet me be thought too busy in my fears--\\nAs worthy cause I have to fear I am--\\nAnd hold her free, I do beseech your Honor.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Fear not my government.\\n\\nIAGO  I once more take my leave.\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nThis fellow\\'s of exceeding honesty,\\nAnd knows all qualities with a learned spirit\\nOf human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,\\nThough that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,\\nI\\'d whistle her off and let her down the wind\\nTo prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black\\nAnd have not those soft parts of conversation\\nThat chamberers have, or for I am declined\\nInto the vale of years--yet that\\'s not much--\\nShe\\'s gone, I am abused, and my relief\\nMust be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,\\nThat we can call these delicate creatures ours\\nAnd not their appetites! I had rather be a toad\\nAnd live upon the vapor of a dungeon\\nThan keep a corner in the thing I love\\nFor others\\' uses. Yet \\'tis the plague of great ones;\\nPrerogatived are they less than the base.\\n\\'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.\\nEven then this forked plague is fated to us\\nWhen we do quicken. Look where she comes.\\n\\n[Enter Desdemona and Emilia.]\\n\\nIf she be false, heaven mocks itself!\\nI\\'ll not believe \\'t.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  How now, my dear Othello?\\nYour dinner, and the generous islanders\\nBy you invited, do attend your presence.\\n\\nOTHELLO  I am to blame.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nWhy do you speak so faintly? Are you not well?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nI have a pain upon my forehead, here.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nFaith, that\\'s with watching. \\'Twill away again.\\nLet me but bind it hard; within this hour\\nIt will be well.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Your napkin is too little.\\nLet it alone.\\t[The handkerchief falls, unnoticed.]\\nCome, I\\'ll go in with you.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nI am very sorry that you are not well.\\n[Othello and Desdemona exit.]\\n\\nEMILIA, [picking up the handkerchief]\\nI am glad I have found this napkin.\\nThis was her first remembrance from the Moor.\\nMy wayward husband hath a hundred times\\nWooed me to steal it. But she so loves the token\\n(For he conjured her she should ever keep it)\\nThat she reserves it evermore about her\\nTo kiss and talk to. I\\'ll have the work ta\\'en out\\nAnd give \\'t Iago. What he will do with it\\nHeaven knows, not I.\\nI nothing but to please his fantasy.\\n\\n[Enter Iago.]\\n\\n\\nIAGO  How now? What do you here alone?\\n\\nEMILIA\\nDo not you chide. I have a thing for you.\\n\\nIAGO\\nYou have a thing for me? It is a common thing--\\n\\nEMILIA  Ha?\\n\\nIAGO  To have a foolish wife.\\n\\nEMILIA\\nO, is that all? What will you give me now\\nFor that same handkerchief?\\n\\nIAGO  What handkerchief?\\n\\nEMILIA  What handkerchief?\\nWhy, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona,\\nThat which so often you did bid me steal.\\n\\nIAGO  Hast stol\\'n it from her?\\n\\nEMILIA\\nNo, faith, she let it drop by negligence,\\nAnd to th\\' advantage I, being here, took \\'t up.\\nLook, here \\'tis.\\n\\nIAGO  A good wench! Give it me.\\n\\nEMILIA\\nWhat will you do with \\'t, that you have been so\\nearnest\\nTo have me filch it?\\n\\nIAGO, [snatching it]  Why, what is that to you?\\n\\nEMILIA\\nIf it be not for some purpose of import,\\nGive \\'t me again. Poor lady, she\\'ll run mad\\nWhen she shall lack it.\\n\\nIAGO  Be not acknown on \\'t.\\nI have use for it. Go, leave me.\\t[Emilia exits.]\\nI will in Cassio\\'s lodging lose this napkin\\nAnd let him find it. Trifles light as air\\nAre to the jealous confirmations strong\\nAs proofs of holy writ. This may do something.\\nThe Moor already changes with my poison;\\nDangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,\\nWhich at the first are scarce found to distaste,\\nBut with a little act upon the blood\\nBurn like the mines of sulfur.\\n\\n[Enter Othello.]\\n\\nI did say so.\\nLook where he comes. Not poppy nor mandragora\\nNor all the drowsy syrups of the world\\nShall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep\\nWhich thou owedst yesterday.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Ha, ha, false to me?\\n\\nIAGO\\nWhy, how now, general? No more of that!\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nAvaunt! Begone! Thou hast set me on the rack.\\nI swear \\'tis better to be much abused\\nThan but to know \\'t a little.\\n\\nIAGO  How now, my lord?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nWhat sense had I of her stol\\'n hours of lust?\\nI saw \\'t not, thought it not; it harmed not me.\\nI slept the next night well, fed well, was free and\\nmerry.\\nI found not Cassio\\'s kisses on her lips.\\nHe that is robbed, not wanting what is stol\\'n,\\nLet him not know \\'t, and he\\'s not robbed at all.\\n\\nIAGO  I am sorry to hear this.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nI had been happy if the general camp,\\nPioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,\\nSo I had nothing known. O, now, forever\\nFarewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content!\\nFarewell the plumed troops and the big wars\\nThat makes ambition virtue! O, farewell!\\nFarewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,\\nThe spirit-stirring drum, th\\' ear-piercing fife,\\nThe royal banner, and all quality,\\nPride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!\\nAnd O you mortal engines, whose rude throats\\nTh\\' immortal Jove\\'s dread clamors counterfeit,\\nFarewell! Othello\\'s occupation\\'s gone!\\n\\nIAGO  Is \\'t possible, my lord?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nVillain, be sure thou prove my love a whore!\\nBe sure of it. Give me the ocular proof,\\nOr, by the worth of mine eternal soul,\\nThou hadst been better have been born a dog\\nThan answer my waked wrath.\\n\\nIAGO  Is \\'t come to this?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nMake me to see \\'t, or at the least so prove it\\nThat the probation bear no hinge nor loop\\nTo hang a doubt on, or woe upon thy life!\\n\\nIAGO  My noble lord--\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nIf thou dost slander her and torture me,\\nNever pray more. Abandon all remorse;\\nOn horror\\'s head horrors accumulate;\\nDo deeds to make heaven weep, all Earth amazed;\\nFor nothing canst thou to damnation add\\nGreater than that.\\n\\nIAGO  O grace! O heaven forgive me!\\nAre you a man? Have you a soul or sense?\\nGod b\\' wi\\' you. Take mine office.--O wretched fool,\\nThat liv\\'st to make thine honesty a vice!--\\nO monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world:\\nTo be direct and honest is not safe.--\\nI thank you for this profit, and from hence\\nI\\'ll love no friend, sith love breeds such offense.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Nay, stay. Thou shouldst be honest.\\n\\nIAGO\\nI should be wise; for honesty\\'s a fool\\nAnd loses that it works for.\\n\\nOTHELLO  By the world,\\nI think my wife be honest and think she is not.\\nI think that thou art just and think thou art not.\\nI\\'ll have some proof! Her name, that was as fresh\\nAs Dian\\'s visage, is now begrimed and black\\nAs mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,\\nPoison, or fire, or suffocating streams,\\nI\\'ll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!\\n\\nIAGO\\nI see you are eaten up with passion.\\nI do repent me that I put it to you.\\nYou would be satisfied?\\n\\nOTHELLO  Would? Nay, and I will.\\n\\nIAGO\\nAnd may; but how? How satisfied, my lord?\\nWould you, the supervisor, grossly gape on,\\nBehold her topped?\\n\\nOTHELLO  Death and damnation! O!\\n\\nIAGO\\nIt were a tedious difficulty, I think,\\nTo bring them to that prospect. Damn them then\\nIf ever mortal eyes do see them bolster\\nMore than their own! What then? How then?\\nWhat shall I say? Where\\'s satisfaction?\\nIt is impossible you should see this,\\nWere they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,\\nAs salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross\\nAs ignorance made drunk. But yet I say,\\nIf imputation and strong circumstances\\nWhich lead directly to the door of truth\\nWill give you satisfaction, you might have \\'t.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nGive me a living reason she\\'s disloyal.\\n\\nIAGO  I do not like the office,\\nBut sith I am entered in this cause so far,\\nPricked to \\'t by foolish honesty and love,\\nI will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,\\nAnd being troubled with a raging tooth\\nI could not sleep. There are a kind of men\\nSo loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter\\nTheir affairs. One of this kind is Cassio.\\nIn sleep I heard him say \"Sweet Desdemona,\\nLet us be wary, let us hide our loves.\"\\nAnd then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,\\nCry \"O sweet creature!\" then kiss me hard,\\nAs if he plucked up kisses by the roots\\nThat grew upon my lips; then laid his leg\\nO\\'er my thigh, and sighed, and kissed, and then\\nCried \"Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!\"\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nO monstrous! Monstrous!\\n\\nIAGO  Nay, this was but his\\ndream.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nBut this denoted a foregone conclusion.\\n\\'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.\\n\\nIAGO\\nAnd this may help to thicken other proofs\\nThat do demonstrate thinly.\\n\\nOTHELLO  I\\'ll tear her all to pieces.\\n\\nIAGO\\nNay, but be wise. Yet we see nothing done.\\nShe may be honest yet. Tell me but this:\\nHave you not sometimes seen a handkerchief\\nSpotted with strawberries in your wife\\'s hand?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nI gave her such a one. \\'Twas my first gift.\\n\\nIAGO\\nI know not that; but such a handkerchief--\\nI am sure it was your wife\\'s--did I today\\nSee Cassio wipe his beard with.\\n\\nOTHELLO  If it be that--\\n\\nIAGO\\nIf it be that, or any that was hers,\\nIt speaks against her with the other proofs.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nO, that the slave had forty thousand lives!\\nOne is too poor, too weak for my revenge.\\nNow do I see \\'tis true. Look here, Iago,\\nAll my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.\\n\\'Tis gone.\\nArise, black vengeance, from the hollow hell!\\nYield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne\\nTo tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,\\nFor \\'tis of aspics\\' tongues!\\n\\nIAGO  Yet be content.\\n\\nOTHELLO  O, blood, blood, blood!\\n\\nIAGO\\nPatience, I say. Your mind perhaps may change.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nNever, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,\\nWhose icy current and compulsive course\\nNe\\'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on\\nTo the Propontic and the Hellespont,\\nEven so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace\\nShall ne\\'er look back, ne\\'er ebb to humble love,\\nTill that a capable and wide revenge\\nSwallow them up. [He kneels.] Now by yond marble\\nheaven,\\nIn the due reverence of a sacred vow,\\nI here engage my words.\\n\\nIAGO  Do not rise yet.\\t[Iago kneels.]\\nWitness, you ever-burning lights above,\\nYou elements that clip us round about,\\nWitness that here Iago doth give up\\nThe execution of his wit, hands, heart\\nTo wronged Othello\\'s service! Let him command,\\nAnd to obey shall be in me remorse,\\nWhat bloody business ever.\\t[They rise.]\\n\\nOTHELLO  I greet thy love\\nNot with vain thanks but with acceptance\\nbounteous,\\nAnd will upon the instant put thee to \\'t.\\nWithin these three days let me hear thee say\\nThat Cassio\\'s not alive.\\n\\nIAGO  My friend is dead.\\n\\'Tis done at your request. But let her live.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her, damn\\nher!\\nCome, go with me apart. I will withdraw\\nTo furnish me with some swift means of death\\nFor the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.\\n\\nIAGO  I am your own forever.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 4\\n=======\\n[Enter Desdemona, Emilia, and Clown.]\\n\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant\\nCassio lies?\\n\\nCLOWN  I dare not say he lies anywhere.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Why, man?\\n\\nCLOWN  He\\'s a soldier, and for me to say a soldier lies,\\n\\'tis stabbing.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Go to! Where lodges he?\\n\\nCLOWN  To tell you where he lodges is to tell you\\nwhere I lie.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Can anything be made of this?\\n\\nCLOWN  I know not where he lodges; and for me to\\ndevise a lodging and say he lies here, or he lies\\nthere, were to lie in mine own throat.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Can you inquire him out, and be edified\\nby report?\\n\\nCLOWN  I will catechize the world for him--that is,\\nmake questions, and by them answer.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I\\nhave moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will\\nbe well.\\n\\nCLOWN  To do this is within the compass of man\\'s wit,\\nand therefore I will attempt the doing it.\\n[Clown exits.]\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nWhere should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?\\n\\nEMILIA  I know not, madam.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nBelieve me, I had rather have lost my purse\\nFull of crusadoes. And but my noble Moor\\nIs true of mind and made of no such baseness\\nAs jealous creatures are, it were enough\\nTo put him to ill thinking.\\n\\nEMILIA  Is he not jealous?\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nWho, he? I think the sun where he was born\\nDrew all such humors from him.\\n\\nEMILIA  Look where he\\ncomes.\\n\\n[Enter Othello.]\\n\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nI will not leave him now till Cassio\\nBe called to him.--How is \\'t with you, my lord?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nWell, my good lady. [Aside.] O, hardness to\\ndissemble!--\\nHow do you, Desdemona?\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Well, my good lord.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nGive me your hand. [He takes her hand.] This hand\\nis moist, my lady.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nIt yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nThis argues fruitfulness and liberal heart.\\nHot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires\\nA sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,\\nMuch castigation, exercise devout;\\nFor here\\'s a young and sweating devil here\\nThat commonly rebels. \\'Tis a good hand,\\nA frank one.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  You may indeed say so,\\nFor \\'twas that hand that gave away my heart.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nA liberal hand! The hearts of old gave hands,\\nBut our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nI cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.\\n\\nOTHELLO  What promise, chuck?\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nI have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nI have a salt and sorry rheum offends me.\\nLend me thy handkerchief.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Here, my lord.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nThat which I gave you.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  I have it not about me.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Not?\\n\\nDESDEMONA  No, faith, my lord.\\n\\nOTHELLO  That\\'s a fault. That handkerchief\\nDid an Egyptian to my mother give.\\nShe was a charmer, and could almost read\\nThe thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept\\nit,\\n\\'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father\\nEntirely to her love. But if she lost it,\\nOr made a gift of it, my father\\'s eye\\nShould hold her loathed, and his spirits should hunt\\nAfter new fancies. She, dying, gave it me,\\nAnd bid me, when my fate would have me wived,\\nTo give it her. I did so; and take heed on \\'t,\\nMake it a darling like your precious eye.\\nTo lose \\'t or give \\'t away were such perdition\\nAs nothing else could match.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Is \\'t possible?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\n\\'Tis true. There\\'s magic in the web of it.\\nA sybil that had numbered in the world\\nThe sun to course two hundred compasses,\\nIn her prophetic fury sewed the work.\\nThe worms were hallowed that did breed the silk,\\nAnd it was dyed in mummy, which the skillful\\nConserved of maidens\\' hearts.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  I\\' faith, is \\'t true?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nMost veritable. Therefore, look to \\'t well.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nThen would to God that I had never seen \\'t!\\n\\nOTHELLO  Ha? Wherefore?\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nWhy do you speak so startingly and rash?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nIs \\'t lost? Is \\'t gone? Speak, is \\'t out o\\' th\\' way?\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Heaven bless us!\\n\\nOTHELLO  Say you?\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nIt is not lost, but what an if it were?\\n\\nOTHELLO  How?\\n\\nDESDEMONA  I say it is not lost.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Fetch \\'t. Let me see \\'t!\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nWhy, so I can. But I will not now.\\nThis is a trick to put me from my suit.\\nPray you, let Cassio be received again.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nFetch me the handkerchief! [Aside.] My mind\\nmisgives.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Come, come.\\nYou\\'ll never meet a more sufficient man.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nThe handkerchief!\\n\\nDESDEMONA  I pray, talk me of Cassio.\\n\\nOTHELLOThe handkerchief!\\n\\nDESDEMONA  A man that all his time\\nHath founded his good fortunes on your love;\\nShared dangers with you--\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nThe handkerchief!\\n\\nDESDEMONA  I\\' faith, you are to blame.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Zounds!\\t[Othello exits.]\\n\\nEMILIA  Is not this man jealous?\\n\\nDESDEMONA  I ne\\'er saw this before.\\nSure, there\\'s some wonder in this handkerchief!\\nI am most unhappy in the loss of it.\\n\\nEMILIA\\n\\'Tis not a year or two shows us a man.\\nThey are all but stomachs, and we all but food;\\nThey eat us hungerly, and when they are full\\nThey belch us.\\n\\n[Enter Iago and Cassio.]\\n\\nLook you--Cassio and my husband.\\n\\nIAGO, [to Cassio]\\nThere is no other way; \\'tis she must do \\'t,\\nAnd, lo, the happiness! Go and importune her.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nHow now, good Cassio, what\\'s the news with you?\\n\\nCASSIO\\nMadam, my former suit. I do beseech you\\nThat by your virtuous means I may again\\nExist, and be a member of his love\\nWhom I with all the office of my heart\\nEntirely honor. I would not be delayed.\\nIf my offense be of such mortal kind\\nThat nor my service past nor present sorrows\\nNor purposed merit in futurity\\nCan ransom me into his love again,\\nBut to know so must be my benefit.\\nSo shall I clothe me in a forced content,\\nAnd shut myself up in some other course\\nTo fortune\\'s alms.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio,\\nMy advocation is not now in tune.\\nMy lord is not my lord; nor should I know him\\nWere he in favor as in humor altered.\\nSo help me every spirit sanctified\\nAs I have spoken for you all my best,\\nAnd stood within the blank of his displeasure\\nFor my free speech! You must awhile be patient.\\nWhat I can do I will; and more I will\\nThan for myself I dare. Let that suffice you.\\n\\nIAGO\\nIs my lord angry?\\n\\nEMILIA  He went hence but now,\\nAnd certainly in strange unquietness.\\n\\nIAGO\\nCan he be angry? I have seen the cannon\\nWhen it hath blown his ranks into the air\\nAnd, like the devil, from his very arm\\nPuffed his own brother--and is he angry?\\nSomething of moment then. I will go meet him.\\nThere\\'s matter in \\'t indeed if he be angry.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nI prithee do so.\\t[He exits.]\\nSomething, sure, of state,\\nEither from Venice, or some unhatched practice\\nMade demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,\\nHath puddled his clear spirit; and in such cases\\nMen\\'s natures wrangle with inferior things,\\nThough great ones are their object. \\'Tis even so.\\nFor let our finger ache, and it endues\\nOur other healthful members even to a sense\\nOf pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods,\\nNor of them look for such observancy\\nAs fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,\\nI was--unhandsome warrior as I am!--\\nArraigning his unkindness with my soul.\\nBut now I find I had suborned the witness,\\nAnd he\\'s indicted falsely.\\n\\nEMILIA  Pray heaven it be\\nState matters, as you think, and no conception\\nNor no jealous toy concerning you.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nAlas the day, I never gave him cause!\\n\\nEMILIA\\nBut jealous souls will not be answered so.\\nThey are not ever jealous for the cause,\\nBut jealous for they\\'re jealous. It is a monster\\nBegot upon itself, born on itself.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nHeaven keep that monster from Othello\\'s mind!\\n\\nEMILIA  Lady, amen.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nI will go seek him.--Cassio, walk hereabout.\\nIf I do find him fit, I\\'ll move your suit\\nAnd seek to effect it to my uttermost.\\n\\nCASSIO  I humbly thank your Ladyship.\\n[Desdemona and Emilia exit.]\\n\\n[Enter Bianca.]\\n\\n\\nBIANCA\\n\\'Save you, friend Cassio!\\n\\nCASSIO  What make you from\\nhome?\\nHow is \\'t with you, my most fair Bianca?\\nI\\' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.\\n\\nBIANCA\\nAnd I was going to your lodging, Cassio.\\nWhat, keep a week away? Seven days and nights,\\nEightscore eight hours, and lovers\\' absent hours\\nMore tedious than the dial eightscore times?\\nO weary reck\\'ning!\\n\\nCASSIO  Pardon me, Bianca.\\nI have this while with leaden thoughts been pressed,\\nBut I shall in a more continuate time\\nStrike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,\\n[Giving her Desdemona\\'s handkerchief.]\\nTake me this work out.\\n\\nBIANCA  O, Cassio, whence came this?\\nThis is some token from a newer friend.\\nTo the felt absence now I feel a cause.\\nIs \\'t come to this? Well, well.\\n\\nCASSIO  Go to, woman!\\nThrow your vile guesses in the devil\\'s teeth,\\nFrom whence you have them. You are jealous now\\nThat this is from some mistress, some\\nremembrance.\\nNo, by my faith, Bianca.\\n\\nBIANCA  Why, whose is it?\\n\\nCASSIO\\nI know not neither. I found it in my chamber.\\nI like the work well. Ere it be demanded,\\nAs like enough it will, I would have it copied.\\nTake it, and do \\'t, and leave me for this time.\\n\\nBIANCA  Leave you? Wherefore?\\n\\nCASSIO\\nI do attend here on the General,\\nAnd think it no addition, nor my wish,\\nTo have him see me womaned.\\n\\nBIANCA  Why, I pray you?\\n\\nCASSIO  Not that I love you not.\\n\\nBIANCA  But that you do not love me!\\nI pray you bring me on the way a little,\\nAnd say if I shall see you soon at night.\\n\\nCASSIO\\n\\'Tis but a little way that I can bring you,\\nFor I attend here. But I\\'ll see you soon.\\n\\nBIANCA\\n\\'Tis very good. I must be circumstanced.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\n\\nACT 4\\n=====\\n\\nScene 1\\n=======\\n[Enter Othello and Iago.]\\n\\n\\nIAGO\\nWill you think so?\\n\\nOTHELLO  Think so, Iago?\\n\\nIAGO  What,\\nTo kiss in private?\\n\\nOTHELLO  An unauthorized kiss!\\n\\nIAGO\\nOr to be naked with her friend in bed\\nAn hour or more, not meaning any harm?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nNaked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm?\\nIt is hypocrisy against the devil!\\nThey that mean virtuously, and yet do so,\\nThe devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt\\nheaven.\\n\\nIAGO\\nIf they do nothing, \\'tis a venial slip.\\nBut if I give my wife a handkerchief--\\n\\nOTHELLO  What then?\\n\\nIAGO\\nWhy then, \\'tis hers, my lord, and being hers,\\nShe may, I think, bestow \\'t on any man.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nShe is protectress of her honor, too.\\nMay she give that?\\n\\nIAGO\\nHer honor is an essence that\\'s not seen;\\nThey have it very oft that have it not.\\nBut for the handkerchief--\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nBy heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.\\nThou saidst--O, it comes o\\'er my memory\\nAs doth the raven o\\'er the infectious house,\\nBoding to all--he had my handkerchief.\\n\\nIAGO\\nAy, what of that?\\n\\nOTHELLO  That\\'s not so good now.\\n\\nIAGO  What\\nIf I had said I had seen him do you wrong?\\nOr heard him say (as knaves be such abroad,\\nWho having, by their own importunate suit\\nOr voluntary dotage of some mistress,\\nConvinced or supplied them, cannot choose\\nBut they must blab)--\\n\\nOTHELLO  Hath he said anything?\\n\\nIAGO\\nHe hath, my lord, but be you well assured,\\nNo more than he\\'ll unswear.\\n\\nOTHELLO  What hath he said?\\n\\nIAGO\\nFaith, that he did--I know not what he did.\\n\\nOTHELLO  What? What?\\n\\nIAGO\\nLie--\\n\\nOTHELLO  With her?\\n\\nIAGO  With her--on her--what you will.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Lie with her? Lie on her? We say \"lie on her\"\\nwhen they belie her. Lie with her--Zounds, that\\'s\\nfulsome! Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief.\\nTo confess and be hanged for his labor.\\nFirst to be hanged and then to confess--I tremble\\nat it. Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing\\npassion without some instruction. It is not\\nwords that shakes me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and\\nlips--is \\'t possible? Confess--handkerchief--O,\\ndevil!\\t[He falls in a trance.]\\n\\nIAGO  Work on,\\nMy medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are\\ncaught,\\nAnd many worthy and chaste dames even thus,\\nAll guiltless, meet reproach.--What ho! My lord!\\nMy lord, I say. Othello!\\n\\n[Enter Cassio.]\\n\\nHow now, Cassio?\\n\\nCASSIO  What\\'s the matter?\\n\\nIAGO\\nMy lord is fall\\'n into an epilepsy.\\nThis is his second fit. He had one yesterday.\\n\\nCASSIO\\nRub him about the temples.\\n\\nIAGO  No, forbear.\\nThe lethargy must have his quiet course.\\nIf not, he foams at mouth, and by and by\\nBreaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs.\\nDo you withdraw yourself a little while.\\nHe will recover straight. When he is gone,\\nI would on great occasion speak with you.\\n[Cassio exits.]\\nHow is it, general? Have you not hurt your head?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nDost thou mock me?\\n\\nIAGO  I mock you not, by heaven!\\nWould you would bear your fortune like a man!\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nA horned man\\'s a monster and a beast.\\n\\nIAGO\\nThere\\'s many a beast, then, in a populous city,\\nAnd many a civil monster.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nDid he confess it?\\n\\nIAGO  Good sir, be a man!\\nThink every bearded fellow that\\'s but yoked\\nMay draw with you. There\\'s millions now alive\\nThat nightly lie in those unproper beds\\nWhich they dare swear peculiar. Your case is better.\\nO, \\'tis the spite of hell, the fiend\\'s arch-mock,\\nTo lip a wanton in a secure couch\\nAnd to suppose her chaste! No, let me know,\\nAnd knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.\\n\\nOTHELLO  O, thou art wise, \\'tis certain.\\n\\nIAGO  Stand you awhile apart.\\nConfine yourself but in a patient list.\\nWhilst you were here, o\\'erwhelmed with your grief--\\nA passion most unsuiting such a man--\\nCassio came hither. I shifted him away\\nAnd laid good \\'scuses upon your ecstasy,\\nBade him anon return and here speak with me,\\nThe which he promised. Do but encave yourself,\\nAnd mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns\\nThat dwell in every region of his face.\\nFor I will make him tell the tale anew--\\nWhere, how, how oft, how long ago, and when\\nHe hath and is again to cope your wife.\\nI say but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,\\nOr I shall say you\\'re all in all in spleen,\\nAnd nothing of a man.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Dost thou hear, Iago,\\nI will be found most cunning in my patience,\\nBut (dost thou hear?) most bloody.\\n\\nIAGO  That\\'s not amiss.\\nBut yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?\\n[Othello withdraws.]\\nNow will I question Cassio of Bianca,\\nA huswife that by selling her desires\\nBuys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature\\nThat dotes on Cassio--as \\'tis the strumpet\\'s plague\\nTo beguile many and be beguiled by one.\\nHe, when he hears of her, cannot restrain\\nFrom the excess of laughter. Here he comes.\\n\\n[Enter Cassio.]\\n\\nAs he shall smile, Othello shall go mad,\\nAnd his unbookish jealousy must construe\\nPoor Cassio\\'s smiles, gestures, and light behaviors\\nQuite in the wrong.--How do you, lieutenant?\\n\\nCASSIO\\nThe worser that you give me the addition\\nWhose want even kills me.\\n\\nIAGO\\nPly Desdemona well, and you are sure on \\'t.\\nNow, if this suit lay in Bianca\\'s power,\\nHow quickly should you speed!\\n\\nCASSIO, [laughing]  Alas, poor caitiff!\\n\\nOTHELLO  Look how he laughs already!\\n\\nIAGO  I never knew woman love man so.\\n\\nCASSIO\\nAlas, poor rogue, I think i\\' faith she loves me.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nNow he denies it faintly and laughs it out.\\n\\nIAGO\\nDo you hear, Cassio?\\n\\nOTHELLO  Now he importunes him\\nTo tell it o\\'er. Go to, well said, well said.\\n\\nIAGO\\nShe gives it out that you shall marry her.\\nDo you intend it?\\n\\nCASSIO  Ha, ha, ha!\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nDo you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?\\n\\nCASSIO  I marry her? What, a customer? Prithee bear\\nsome charity to my wit! Do not think it so unwholesome.\\nHa, ha, ha!\\n\\nOTHELLO  So, so, so, so. They laugh that wins.\\n\\nIAGO\\nFaith, the cry goes that you marry her.\\n\\nCASSIO  Prithee say true!\\n\\nIAGO  I am a very villain else.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Have you scored me? Well.\\n\\nCASSIO  This is the monkey\\'s own giving out. She is\\npersuaded I will marry her out of her own love and\\nflattery, not out of my promise.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nIago beckons me. Now he begins the story.\\n\\nCASSIO  She was here even now. She haunts me in\\nevery place. I was the other day talking on the\\nsea-bank with certain Venetians, and thither comes\\nthe bauble. By this hand, she falls thus about my\\nneck!\\n\\nOTHELLO  Crying, \"O dear Cassio,\" as it were; his\\ngesture imports it.\\n\\nCASSIO  So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me, so\\nshakes and pulls me. Ha, ha, ha!\\n\\nOTHELLO  Now he tells how she plucked him to my\\nchamber.--O, I see that nose of yours, but not that\\ndog I shall throw it to.\\n\\nCASSIO  Well, I must leave her company.\\n\\nIAGO  Before me, look where she comes.\\n\\n[Enter Bianca.]\\n\\n\\nCASSIO  \\'Tis such another fitchew--marry, a perfumed\\none!--What do you mean by this haunting\\nof me?\\n\\nBIANCA  Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did\\nyou mean by that same handkerchief you gave me\\neven now? I was a fine fool to take it! I must take\\nout the work? A likely piece of work, that you\\nshould find it in your chamber and know not who\\nleft it there! This is some minx\\'s token, and I must\\ntake out the work! There, give it your hobbyhorse.\\nWheresoever you had it, I\\'ll take out no work on \\'t.\\n\\nCASSIO\\nHow now, my sweet Bianca? How now? How now?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nBy heaven, that should be my handkerchief!\\n\\nBIANCA  If you\\'ll come to supper tonight you may. If\\nyou will not, come when you are next prepared\\nfor.\\t[She exits.]\\n\\nIAGO  After her, after her!\\n\\nCASSIO  Faith, I must. She\\'ll rail in the streets else.\\n\\nIAGO  Will you sup there?\\n\\nCASSIO  Faith, I intend so.\\n\\nIAGO  Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very\\nfain speak with you.\\n\\nCASSIO  Prithee come. Will you?\\n\\nIAGO  Go to; say no more.\\t[Cassio exits.]\\n\\nOTHELLO, [coming forward]  How shall I murder him,\\nIago?\\n\\nIAGO  Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?\\n\\nOTHELLO  O Iago!\\n\\nIAGO  And did you see the handkerchief?\\n\\nOTHELLO  Was that mine?\\n\\nIAGO  Yours, by this hand! And to see how he prizes\\nthe foolish woman your wife! She gave it him, and\\nhe hath giv\\'n it his whore.\\n\\nOTHELLO  I would have him nine years a-killing! A fine\\nwoman, a fair woman, a sweet woman!\\n\\nIAGO  Nay, you must forget that.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Ay, let her rot and perish and be damned\\ntonight, for she shall not live. No, my heart is turned\\nto stone. I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the\\nworld hath not a sweeter creature! She might lie by\\nan emperor\\'s side and command him tasks.\\n\\nIAGO  Nay, that\\'s not your way.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Hang her, I do but say what she is! So\\ndelicate with her needle, an admirable musician--\\nO, she will sing the savageness out of a bear!\\nOf so high and plenteous wit and invention!\\n\\nIAGO  She\\'s the worse for all this.\\n\\nOTHELLO  O, a thousand, a thousand times!--And then\\nof so gentle a condition!\\n\\nIAGO  Ay, too gentle.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Nay, that\\'s certain. But yet the pity of it,\\nIago! O, Iago, the pity of it, Iago!\\n\\nIAGO  If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her\\npatent to offend, for if it touch not you, it comes\\nnear nobody.\\n\\nOTHELLO  I will chop her into messes! Cuckold me?\\n\\nIAGO  O, \\'tis foul in her.\\n\\nOTHELLO  With mine officer!\\n\\nIAGO  That\\'s fouler.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Get me some poison, Iago, this night. I\\'ll not\\nexpostulate with her lest her body and beauty\\nunprovide my mind again. This night, Iago.\\n\\nIAGO  Do it not with poison. Strangle her in her bed,\\neven the bed she hath contaminated.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Good, good. The justice of it pleases. Very\\ngood.\\n\\nIAGO  And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker. You\\nshall hear more by midnight.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nExcellent good.\\t[A trumpet sounds.]\\nWhat trumpet is that same?\\n\\nIAGO  I warrant something from Venice.\\n\\n[Enter Lodovico, Desdemona, and Attendants.]\\n\\n\\'Tis Lodovico. This comes from the Duke.\\nSee, your wife\\'s with him.\\n\\nLODOVICO  God save you, worthy general.\\n\\nOTHELLO  With all my heart, sir.\\n\\nLODOVICO\\nThe Duke and the Senators of Venice greet you.\\n[He hands Othello a paper.]\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nI kiss the instrument of their pleasures.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nAnd what\\'s the news, good cousin Lodovico?\\n\\nIAGO\\nI am very glad to see you, signior.\\nWelcome to Cyprus.\\n\\nLODOVICO\\nI thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?\\n\\nIAGO  Lives, sir.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nCousin, there\\'s fall\\'n between him and my lord\\nAn unkind breach, but you shall make all well.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Are you sure of that?\\n\\nDESDEMONA  My lord?\\n\\nOTHELLO, [reading]  \"This fail you not to do, as you\\nwill\"--\\n\\nLODOVICO\\nHe did not call; he\\'s busy in the paper.\\nIs there division \\'twixt my lord and Cassio?\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nA most unhappy one. I would do much\\nT\\' atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Fire and brimstone!\\n\\nDESDEMONA  My lord?\\n\\nOTHELLO  Are you wise?\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nWhat, is he angry?\\n\\nLODOVICO  May be the letter moved him.\\nFor, as I think, they do command him home,\\nDeputing Cassio in his government.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  By my troth, I am glad on \\'t.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Indeed?\\n\\nDESDEMONA  My lord?\\n\\nOTHELLO  I am glad to see you mad.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Why, sweet Othello!\\n\\nOTHELLO, [striking her]  Devil!\\n\\nDESDEMONA  I have not deserved this.\\n\\nLODOVICO\\nMy lord, this would not be believed in Venice,\\nThough I should swear I saw \\'t. \\'Tis very much.\\nMake her amends. She weeps.\\n\\nOTHELLO  O, devil, devil!\\nIf that the Earth could teem with woman\\'s tears,\\nEach drop she falls would prove a crocodile.\\nOut of my sight!\\n\\nDESDEMONA  I will not stay to offend you.\\n[She begins to leave.]\\n\\nLODOVICO  Truly an obedient lady.\\nI do beseech your Lordship call her back.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Mistress.\\n\\nDESDEMONA, [turning back]  My lord?\\n\\nOTHELLO  What would you with her, sir?\\n\\nLODOVICO  Who, I, my lord?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nAy, you did wish that I would make her turn.\\nSir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,\\nAnd turn again. And she can weep, sir, weep.\\nAnd she\\'s obedient, as you say, obedient.\\nVery obedient.--Proceed you in your tears.--\\nConcerning this, sir--O, well-painted passion!--\\nI am commanded home.--Get you away.\\nI\\'ll send for you anon.--Sir, I obey the mandate\\nAnd will return to Venice.--Hence, avaunt!\\n[Desdemona exits.]\\nCassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight\\nI do entreat that we may sup together.\\nYou are welcome, sir, to Cyprus. Goats and\\nmonkeys!\\t[He exits.]\\n\\nLODOVICO\\nIs this the noble Moor, whom our full senate\\nCall all in all sufficient? Is this the nature\\nWhom passion could not shake, whose solid virtue\\nThe shot of accident nor dart of chance\\nCould neither graze nor pierce?\\n\\nIAGO  He is much\\nchanged.\\n\\nLODOVICO\\nAre his wits safe? Is he not light of brain?\\n\\nIAGO\\nHe\\'s that he is. I may not breathe my censure\\nWhat he might be. If what he might he is not,\\nI would to heaven he were.\\n\\nLODOVICO  What? Strike his wife?\\n\\nIAGO\\n\\'Faith, that was not so well. Yet would I knew\\nThat stroke would prove the worst.\\n\\nLODOVICO  Is it his use?\\nOr did the letters work upon his blood\\nAnd new-create this fault?\\n\\nIAGO  Alas, alas!\\nIt is not honesty in me to speak\\nWhat I have seen and known. You shall observe\\nhim,\\nAnd his own courses will denote him so\\nThat I may save my speech. Do but go after\\nAnd mark how he continues.\\n\\nLODOVICO\\nI am sorry that I am deceived in him.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 2\\n=======\\n[Enter Othello and Emilia.]\\n\\n\\nOTHELLO  You have seen nothing then?\\n\\nEMILIA\\nNor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nYes, you have seen Cassio and she together.\\n\\nEMILIA\\nBut then I saw no harm, and then I heard\\nEach syllable that breath made up between them.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nWhat, did they never whisper?\\n\\nEMILIA  Never, my lord.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Nor send you out o\\' th\\' way?\\n\\nEMILIA  Never.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nTo fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?\\n\\nEMILIA  Never, my lord.\\n\\nOTHELLO  That\\'s strange.\\n\\nEMILIA\\nI durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,\\nLay down my soul at stake. If you think other,\\nRemove your thought. It doth abuse your bosom.\\nIf any wretch have put this in your head,\\nLet heaven requite it with the serpent\\'s curse,\\nFor if she be not honest, chaste, and true,\\nThere\\'s no man happy. The purest of their wives\\nIs foul as slander.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Bid her come hither. Go.\\n[Emilia exits.]\\nShe says enough. Yet she\\'s a simple bawd\\nThat cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,\\nA closet lock and key of villainous secrets.\\nAnd yet she\\'ll kneel and pray. I have seen her do \\'t.\\n\\n[Enter Desdemona and Emilia.]\\n\\n\\nDESDEMONA  My lord, what is your will?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nPray you, chuck, come hither.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  What is your\\npleasure?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nLet me see your eyes. Look in my face.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  What horrible fancy\\'s this?\\n\\nOTHELLO, [to Emilia]  Some of your function,\\nmistress.\\nLeave procreants alone, and shut the door.\\nCough, or cry \"hem,\" if anybody come.\\nYour mystery, your mystery! Nay, dispatch.\\n[Emilia exits.]\\n\\nDESDEMONA, [kneeling]\\nUpon my knees, what doth your speech import?\\nI understand a fury in your words,\\nBut not the words.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Why? What art thou?\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nYour wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Come, swear it. Damn thyself,\\nLest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves\\nShould fear to seize thee. Therefore be double\\ndamned.\\nSwear thou art honest.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Heaven doth truly know it.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nHeaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.\\n\\nDESDEMONA, [standing]\\nTo whom, my lord? With whom? How am I false?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nAh, Desdemon, away, away, away!\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nAlas the heavy day, why do you weep?\\nAm I the motive of these tears, my lord?\\nIf haply you my father do suspect\\nAn instrument of this your calling back,\\nLay not your blame on me. If you have lost him,\\nI have lost him too.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Had it pleased heaven\\nTo try me with affliction, had they rained\\nAll kind of sores and shames on my bare head,\\nSteeped me in poverty to the very lips,\\nGiven to captivity me and my utmost hopes,\\nI should have found in some place of my soul\\nA drop of patience. But alas, to make me\\nA fixed figure for the time of scorn\\nTo point his slow unmoving finger at--\\nYet could I bear that too, well, very well.\\nBut there where I have garnered up my heart,\\nWhere either I must live or bear no life,\\nThe fountain from the which my current runs\\nOr else dries up--to be discarded thence,\\nOr keep it as a cistern for foul toads\\nTo knot and gender in--turn thy complexion there,\\nPatience, thou young and rose-lipped cherubin,\\nAy, there look grim as hell.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nI hope my noble lord esteems me honest.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nO, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles,\\nThat quicken even with blowing! O thou weed,\\nWho art so lovely fair, and smell\\'st so sweet\\nThat the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst\\nne\\'er been born!\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nAlas, what ignorant sin have I committed?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nWas this fair paper, this most goodly book,\\nMade to write \"whore\" upon? What committed?\\nCommitted? O thou public commoner,\\nI should make very forges of my cheeks\\nThat would to cinders burn up modesty,\\nDid I but speak thy deeds. What committed?\\nHeaven stops the nose at it, and the moon winks;\\nThe bawdy wind that kisses all it meets\\nIs hushed within the hollow mine of earth\\nAnd will not hear \\'t. What committed?\\nImpudent strumpet!\\n\\nDESDEMONA  By heaven, you do me wrong!\\n\\nOTHELLO  Are not you a strumpet?\\n\\nDESDEMONA  No, as I am a Christian!\\nIf to preserve this vessel for my lord\\nFrom any other foul unlawful touch\\nBe not to be a strumpet, I am none.\\n\\nOTHELLO  What, not a whore?\\n\\nDESDEMONA  No, as I shall be saved.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Is \\'t possible?\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nO, heaven forgive us!\\n\\nOTHELLO  I cry you mercy, then.\\nI took you for that cunning whore of Venice\\nThat married with Othello.--You, mistress,\\n\\n[Enter Emilia.]\\n\\nThat have the office opposite to Saint Peter\\nAnd keeps the gate of hell--you, you, ay, you!\\nWe have done our course. There\\'s money for your\\npains.\\t[He gives her money.]\\nI pray you turn the key and keep our counsel.\\n[He exits.]\\n\\nEMILIA\\nAlas, what does this gentleman conceive?\\nHow do you, madam? How do you, my good lady?\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Faith, half asleep.\\n\\nEMILIA\\nGood madam, what\\'s the matter with my lord?\\n\\nDESDEMONA  With who?\\n\\nEMILIA  Why, with my lord, madam.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nWho is thy lord?\\n\\nEMILIA  He that is yours, sweet lady.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nI have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia.\\nI cannot weep, nor answers have I none\\nBut what should go by water. Prithee, tonight\\nLay on my bed my wedding sheets. Remember.\\nAnd call thy husband hither.\\n\\nEMILIA  Here\\'s a change indeed.\\t[She exits.]\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\n\\'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.\\nHow have I been behaved that he might stick\\nThe small\\'st opinion on my least misuse?\\n\\n[Enter Iago and Emilia.]\\n\\n\\nIAGO\\nWhat is your pleasure, madam? How is \\'t with you?\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nI cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes\\nDo it with gentle means and easy tasks.\\nHe might have chid me so, for, in good faith,\\nI am a child to chiding.\\n\\nIAGO  What is the matter, lady?\\n\\nEMILIA\\nAlas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,\\nThrown such despite and heavy terms upon her\\nAs true hearts cannot bear.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nAm I that name, Iago?\\n\\nIAGO  What name, fair\\nlady?\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nSuch as she said my lord did say I was.\\n\\nEMILIA\\nHe called her \"whore.\" A beggar in his drink\\nCould not have laid such terms upon his callet.\\n\\nIAGO  Why did he so?\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nI do not know. I am sure I am none such.\\n\\nIAGO\\nDo not weep, do not weep! Alas the day!\\n\\nEMILIA\\nHath she forsook so many noble matches,\\nHer father and her country and her friends,\\nTo be called \"whore\"? Would it not make one\\nweep?\\n\\nDESDEMONA  It is my wretched fortune.\\n\\nIAGO\\nBeshrew him for \\'t! How comes this trick upon him?\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Nay, heaven doth know.\\n\\nEMILIA\\nI will be hanged if some eternal villain,\\nSome busy and insinuating rogue,\\nSome cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,\\nHave not devised this slander. I will be hanged else.\\n\\nIAGO\\nFie, there is no such man. It is impossible.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nIf any such there be, heaven pardon him.\\n\\nEMILIA\\nA halter pardon him, and hell gnaw his bones!\\nWhy should he call her \"whore\"? Who keeps her\\ncompany?\\nWhat place? What time? What form? What\\nlikelihood?\\nThe Moor\\'s abused by some most villainous knave,\\nSome base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.\\nO heaven, that such companions thou \\'dst unfold,\\nAnd put in every honest hand a whip\\nTo lash the rascals naked through the world,\\nEven from the east to th\\' west!\\n\\nIAGO  Speak within door.\\n\\nEMILIA\\nO, fie upon them! Some such squire he was\\nThat turned your wit the seamy side without\\nAnd made you to suspect me with the Moor.\\n\\nIAGO\\nYou are a fool. Go to!\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Alas, Iago,\\nWhat shall I do to win my lord again?\\nGood friend, go to him. For by this light of heaven,\\nI know not how I lost him. [She kneels.] Here I\\nkneel.\\nIf e\\'er my will did trespass \\'gainst his love,\\nEither in discourse of thought or actual deed,\\nOr that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense\\nDelighted them in any other form,\\nOr that I do not yet, and ever did,\\nAnd ever will--though he do shake me off\\nTo beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,\\nComfort forswear me! [She stands.] Unkindness may\\ndo much,\\nAnd his unkindness may defeat my life,\\nBut never taint my love. I cannot say \"whore\"--\\nIt does abhor me now I speak the word.\\nTo do the act that might the addition earn,\\nNot the world\\'s mass of vanity could make me.\\n\\nIAGO\\nI pray you be content. \\'Tis but his humor.\\nThe business of the state does him offense,\\nAnd he does chide with you.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nIf \\'twere no other--\\n\\nIAGO  It is but so, I warrant.\\n[Trumpets sound.]\\nHark how these instruments summon to supper.\\nThe messengers of Venice stays the meat.\\nGo in and weep not. All things shall be well.\\n[Desdemona and Emilia exit.]\\n\\n[Enter Roderigo.]\\n\\nHow now, Roderigo?\\n\\nRODERIGO  I do not find\\nThat thou deal\\'st justly with me.\\n\\nIAGO  What in the contrary?\\n\\nRODERIGO  Every day thou daff\\'st me with some device,\\nIago, and rather, as it seems to me now,\\nkeep\\'st from me all conveniency than suppliest me\\nwith the least advantage of hope. I will indeed no\\nlonger endure it. Nor am I yet persuaded to put up\\nin peace what already I have foolishly suffered.\\n\\nIAGO  Will you hear me, Roderigo?\\n\\nRODERIGO  Faith, I have heard too much, and your\\nwords and performances are no kin together.\\n\\nIAGO  You charge me most unjustly.\\n\\nRODERIGO  With naught but truth. I have wasted myself\\nout of my means. The jewels you have had\\nfrom me to deliver to Desdemona would half have\\ncorrupted a votaress. You have told me she hath\\nreceived them, and returned me expectations and\\ncomforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I\\nfind none.\\n\\nIAGO  Well, go to! Very well.\\n\\nRODERIGO  \"Very well.\" \"Go to!\" I cannot go to, man,\\nnor \\'tis not very well! By this hand, I say \\'tis very\\nscurvy, and begin to find myself fopped in it.\\n\\nIAGO  Very well.\\n\\nRODERIGO  I tell you \\'tis not very well! I will make\\nmyself known to Desdemona. If she will return me\\nmy jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my\\nunlawful solicitation. If not, assure yourself I will\\nseek satisfaction of you.\\n\\nIAGO  You have said now.\\n\\nRODERIGO  Ay, and said nothing but what I protest\\nintendment of doing.\\n\\nIAGO  Why, now I see there\\'s mettle in thee, and even\\nfrom this instant do build on thee a better opinion\\nthan ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo.\\nThou hast taken against me a most just exception,\\nbut yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy\\naffair.\\n\\nRODERIGO  It hath not appeared.\\n\\nIAGO  I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your\\nsuspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,\\nRoderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed which I\\nhave greater reason to believe now than ever--I\\nmean purpose, courage, and valor--this night show\\nit. If thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,\\ntake me from this world with treachery and\\ndevise engines for my life.\\n\\nRODERIGO  Well, what is it? Is it within reason and\\ncompass?\\n\\nIAGO  Sir, there is especial commission come from\\nVenice to depute Cassio in Othello\\'s place.\\n\\nRODERIGO  Is that true? Why, then, Othello and Desdemona\\nreturn again to Venice.\\n\\nIAGO  O, no. He goes into Mauritania and takes away\\nwith him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be\\nlingered here by some accident--wherein none\\ncan be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.\\n\\nRODERIGO  How do you mean, removing him?\\n\\nIAGO  Why, by making him uncapable of Othello\\'s\\nplace: knocking out his brains.\\n\\nRODERIGO  And that you would have me to do?\\n\\nIAGO  Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He\\nsups tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to\\nhim. He knows not yet of his honorable fortune. If\\nyou will watch his going thence (which I will\\nfashion to fall out between twelve and one), you may\\ntake him at your pleasure. I will be near to second\\nyour attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come,\\nstand not amazed at it, but go along with me. I will\\nshow you such a necessity in his death that you shall\\nthink yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high\\nsupper time, and the night grows to waste. About it!\\n\\nRODERIGO  I will hear further reason for this.\\n\\nIAGO  And you shall be satisfied.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\nScene 3\\n=======\\n[Enter Othello, Lodovico, Desdemona, Emilia, and\\nAttendants.]\\n\\n\\nLODOVICO\\nI do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nO, pardon me, \\'twill do me good to walk.\\n\\nLODOVICO\\nMadam, good night. I humbly thank your Ladyship.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Your Honor is most welcome.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nWill you walk, sir?--O, Desdemona--\\n\\nDESDEMONA  My lord?\\n\\nOTHELLO  Get you to bed on th\\' instant. I will be\\nreturned forthwith. Dismiss your attendant there.\\nLook \\'t be done.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  I will, my lord.\\n[All but Desdemona and Emilia exit.]\\n\\nEMILIA\\nHow goes it now? He looks gentler than he did.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nHe says he will return incontinent,\\nAnd hath commanded me to go to bed,\\nAnd bade me to dismiss you.\\n\\nEMILIA  Dismiss me?\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nIt was his bidding. Therefore, good Emilia,\\nGive me my nightly wearing, and adieu.\\nWe must not now displease him.\\n\\nEMILIA  I would you had never seen him.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nSo would not I. My love doth so approve him\\nThat even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns--\\nPrithee, unpin me--have grace and favor in them.\\n\\nEMILIA\\nI have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nAll\\'s one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!\\nIf I do die before thee, prithee, shroud me\\nIn one of those same sheets.\\n\\nEMILIA  Come, come, you talk!\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nMy mother had a maid called Barbary.\\nShe was in love, and he she loved proved mad\\nAnd did forsake her. She had a song of willow,\\nAn old thing \\'twas, but it expressed her fortune,\\nAnd she died singing it. That song tonight\\nWill not go from my mind. I have much to do\\nBut to go hang my head all at one side\\nAnd sing it like poor Barbary. Prithee, dispatch.\\n\\nEMILIA  Shall I go fetch your nightgown?\\n\\nDESDEMONA  No, unpin me here.\\nThis Lodovico is a proper man.\\n\\nEMILIA  A very handsome man.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  He speaks well.\\n\\nEMILIA  I know a lady in Venice would have walked\\nbarefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.\\n\\nDESDEMONA, [singing]\\n\\tThe poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,\\n\\t   Sing all a green willow.\\n\\tHer hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,\\n\\t   Sing willow, willow, willow.\\n\\tThe fresh streams ran by her and murmured her\\nmoans,\\n\\t   Sing willow, willow, willow;\\n\\tHer salt tears fell from her, and softened the\\nstones--\\nLay by these.\\n\\t   Sing willow, willow, willow.\\nPrithee hie thee! He\\'ll come anon.\\n\\tSing all a green willow must be my garland.\\n\\tLet nobody blame him, his scorn I approve.\\nNay, that\\'s not next. Hark, who is \\'t that knocks?\\n\\nEMILIA  It\\'s the wind.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\n\\tI called my love false love, but what said he then?\\n\\t   Sing willow, willow, willow.\\n\\tIf I court more women, you\\'ll couch with more\\nmen.--\\nSo, get thee gone. Good night. Mine eyes do itch;\\nDoth that bode weeping?\\n\\nEMILIA  \\'Tis neither here nor there.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nI have heard it said so. O these men, these men!\\nDost thou in conscience think--tell me, Emilia--\\nThat there be women do abuse their husbands\\nIn such gross kind?\\n\\nEMILIA  There be some such, no\\nquestion.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nWouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?\\n\\nEMILIA\\nWhy, would not you?\\n\\nDESDEMONA  No, by this heavenly light!\\n\\nEMILIA\\nNor I neither, by this heavenly light.\\nI might do \\'t as well i\\' th\\' dark.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nWouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?\\n\\nEMILIA  The world\\'s a huge thing. It is a great price\\nfor a small vice.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  In troth, I think thou wouldst not.\\n\\nEMILIA  In troth, I think I should, and undo \\'t when I\\nhad done it. Marry, I would not do such a thing for\\na joint ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for\\ngowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition.\\nBut for the whole world--\\'Uds pity! Who\\nwould not make her husband a cuckold to make\\nhim a monarch? I should venture purgatory for \\'t.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Beshrew me if I would do such a wrong\\nfor the whole world!\\n\\nEMILIA  Why, the wrong is but a wrong i\\' th\\' world;\\nand, having the world for your labor, \\'tis a wrong in\\nyour own world, and you might quickly make it\\nright.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  I do not think there is any such woman.\\n\\nEMILIA  Yes, a dozen; and as many to th\\' vantage as\\nwould store the world they played for.\\nBut I do think it is their husbands\\' faults\\nIf wives do fall. Say that they slack their duties,\\nAnd pour our treasures into foreign laps;\\nOr else break out in peevish jealousies,\\nThrowing restraint upon us. Or say they strike us,\\nOr scant our former having in despite.\\nWhy, we have galls, and though we have some grace,\\nYet have we some revenge. Let husbands know\\nTheir wives have sense like them. They see, and\\nsmell,\\nAnd have their palates both for sweet and sour,\\nAs husbands have. What is it that they do\\nWhen they change us for others? Is it sport?\\nI think it is. And doth affection breed it?\\nI think it doth. Is \\'t frailty that thus errs?\\nIt is so too. And have not we affections,\\nDesires for sport, and frailty, as men have?\\nThen let them use us well. Else let them know,\\nThe ills we do, their ills instruct us so.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nGood night, good night. God me such uses send,\\nNot to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend.\\n[They exit.]\\n\\n\\nACT 5\\n=====\\n\\nScene 1\\n=======\\n[Enter Iago and Roderigo.]\\n\\n\\nIAGO\\nHere, stand behind this bulk. Straight will he\\ncome.\\nWear thy good rapier bare, and put it home.\\nQuick, quick! Fear nothing. I\\'ll be at thy elbow.\\nIt makes us or it mars us--think on that,\\nAnd fix most firm thy resolution.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\nBe near at hand. I may miscarry in \\'t.\\n\\nIAGO\\nHere, at thy hand. Be bold and take thy stand.\\n[He moves aside.]\\n\\nRODERIGO\\nI have no great devotion to the deed,\\nAnd yet he hath given me satisfying reasons.\\n\\'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword! He dies.\\n[He draws his sword.]\\n\\nIAGO, [aside]\\nI have rubbed this young quat almost to the sense,\\nAnd he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,\\nOr Cassio him, or each do kill the other,\\nEvery way makes my gain. Live Roderigo,\\nHe calls me to a restitution large\\nOf gold and jewels that I bobbed from him\\nAs gifts to Desdemona.\\nIt must not be. If Cassio do remain,\\nHe hath a daily beauty in his life\\nThat makes me ugly. And besides, the Moor\\nMay unfold me to him. There stand I in much peril.\\nNo, he must die. Be \\'t so. I hear him coming.\\n\\n[Enter Cassio.]\\n\\n\\nRODERIGO\\nI know his gait. \\'Tis he!--Villain, thou diest!\\n[He thrusts at Cassio.]\\n\\nCASSIO\\nThat thrust had been mine enemy indeed\\nBut that my coat is better than thou know\\'st.\\nI will make proof of thine.\\n[He draws, and stabs Roderigo.]\\n\\nRODERIGO  O, I am slain!\\n[Roderigo falls.]\\n[Iago stabs Cassio in the leg, and exits.]\\n\\nCASSIO\\nI am maimed forever! Help, ho! Murder, murder!\\n\\n[Enter Othello.]\\n\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nThe voice of Cassio!

O brave Iago, honest and just,\\nThat hast such noble sense of thy friend\\'s wrong!\\nThou teachest me.--Minion, your dear lies dead,\\nAnd your unblest fate hies. Strumpet, I come.\\nForth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are\\nblotted.\\nThy bed, lust-stained, shall with lust\\'s blood be\\nspotted.\\t[Othello exits.]\\n\\n[Enter Lodovico and Gratiano.]\\n\\n\\nCASSIO\\nWhat ho! No watch? No passage? Murder, murder!\\n\\nGRATIANO\\n\\'Tis some mischance.

For heaven\\'s sake, help me!\\n\\nIAGO  What\\'s the matter?\\n\\nGRATIANO, [to Lodovico]\\nThis is Othello\\'s ancient, as I take it.\\n\\nLODOVICO\\nThe same indeed, a very valiant fellow.\\n\\nIAGO, [to Cassio]\\nWhat are you here that cry so grievously?\\n\\nCASSIO\\nIago? O, I am spoiled, undone by villains.\\nGive me some help!\\n\\nIAGO\\nO me, lieutenant! What villains have done this?\\n\\nCASSIO\\nI think that one of them is hereabout\\nAnd cannot make away.\\n\\nIAGO  O treacherous villains!\\n[To Lodovico and Gratiano.] What are you there?\\nCome in, and give some help.\\n\\nRODERIGO  O, help me here!\\n\\nCASSIO\\nThat\\'s one of them.\\n\\nIAGO, [to Roderigo]  O murd\\'rous slave!

I\\'ll bind it with my shirt.\\n\\n[Enter Bianca.]\\n\\n\\nBIANCA\\nWhat is the matter, ho? Who is \\'t that cried?\\n\\nIAGO\\nWho is \\'t that cried?\\n\\nBIANCA  O, my dear Cassio,\\nMy sweet Cassio! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!\\n\\nIAGO\\nO notable strumpet!

So.--O for a chair\\nTo bear him easily hence!\\n\\nBIANCA\\nAlas, he faints. O, Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!\\n\\nIAGO\\nGentlemen all, I do suspect this trash\\nTo be a party in this injury.--\\nPatience awhile, good Cassio.--Come, come;\\nLend me a light. [Peering at Roderigo.] Know we this\\nface or no?\\nAlas, my friend and my dear countryman\\nRoderigo? No! Yes, sure. O heaven, Roderigo!\\n\\nGRATIANO  What, of Venice?\\n\\nIAGO  Even he, sir. Did you know him?\\n\\nGRATIANO  Know him? Ay.\\n\\nIAGO\\nSignior Gratiano? I cry your gentle pardon.\\nThese bloody accidents must excuse my manners\\nThat so neglected you.\\n\\nGRATIANO  I am glad to see you.\\n\\nIAGO\\nHow do you, Cassio?--O, a chair, a chair!\\n\\nGRATIANO  Roderigo?\\n\\nIAGO\\nHe, he, \\'tis he! [A chair is brought in.] O, that\\'s well\\nsaid; the chair.--\\nSome good man bear him carefully from hence.\\nI\\'ll fetch the General\\'s surgeon.-- For you, mistress,\\nSave you your labor.--He that lies slain here,\\nCassio,\\nWas my dear friend. What malice was between you?\\n\\nCASSIO\\nNone in the world. Nor do I know the man.\\n\\nIAGO, [to Bianca]\\nWhat, look you pale?--O, bear him out o\\' th\\' air.\\n[Cassio, in the chair, and Roderigo are carried off.]\\n[To Gratiano and Lodovico.] Stay you, good\\ngentlemen.--Look you pale, mistress?--\\nDo you perceive the gastness of her eye?--\\nNay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.--\\nBehold her well. I pray you, look upon her.\\nDo you see, gentlemen? Nay, guiltiness will speak\\nThough tongues were out of use.\\n\\n[Enter Emilia.]\\n\\n\\nEMILIA\\nAlas, what is the matter? What is the matter,\\nhusband?\\n\\nIAGO\\nCassio hath here been set on in the dark\\nBy Roderigo and fellows that are scaped.\\nHe\\'s almost slain, and Roderigo dead.\\n\\nEMILIA\\nAlas, good gentleman! Alas, good Cassio!\\n\\nIAGO\\nThis is the fruits of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,\\nGo know of Cassio where he supped tonight.\\n[To Bianca.] What, do you shake at that?\\n\\nBIANCA\\nHe supped at my house, but I therefore shake not.\\n\\nIAGO\\nO, did he so? I charge you go with me.\\n\\nEMILIA  O fie upon thee, strumpet!\\n\\nBIANCA\\nI am no strumpet, but of life as honest\\nAs you that thus abuse me.\\n\\nEMILIA  As I? Faugh! Fie upon thee!\\n\\nIAGO\\nKind gentlemen, let\\'s go see poor Cassio dressed.--\\nCome, mistress, you must tell \\'s another tale.--\\nEmilia, run you to the citadel\\nAnd tell my lord and lady what hath happed.--\\nWill you go on afore? [Aside.] This is the night\\nThat either makes me or fordoes me quite.\\n[They exit in different directions.]\\n\\nScene 2\\n=======\\n[Enter Othello with a light, and Desdemona in her bed.]\\n\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nIt is the cause, it is the cause, my soul.\\nLet me not name it to you, you chaste stars.\\nIt is the cause. Yet I\\'ll not shed her blood,\\nNor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,\\nAnd smooth as monumental alabaster.\\nYet she must die, else she\\'ll betray more men.\\nPut out the light, and then put out the light.\\nIf I quench thee, thou flaming minister,\\nI can again thy former light restore\\nShould I repent me. But once put out thy light,\\nThou cunning\\'st pattern of excelling nature,\\nI know not where is that Promethean heat\\nThat can thy light relume. When I have plucked the\\nrose,\\nI cannot give it vital growth again.\\nIt needs must wither. I\\'ll smell it on the tree.\\nO balmy breath, that dost almost persuade\\nJustice to break her sword! [He kisses her.] One\\nmore, one more.\\nBe thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee\\nAnd love thee after. One more, and this the last.\\n[He kisses her.]\\nSo sweet was ne\\'er so fatal. I must weep,\\nBut they are cruel tears. This sorrow\\'s heavenly:\\nIt strikes where it doth love. She wakes.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nWho\\'s there? Othello?\\n\\nOTHELLO  Ay, Desdemona.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Will you come to bed, my lord?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nHave you prayed tonight, Desdemon?\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Ay, my lord.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nIf you bethink yourself of any crime\\nUnreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,\\nSolicit for it straight.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Alack, my lord,\\nWhat may you mean by that?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nWell, do it, and be brief. I will walk by.\\nI would not kill thy unprepared spirit.\\nNo, heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Talk you of killing?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nAy, I do.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Then heaven have mercy on me.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Amen, with all my heart.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nIf you say so, I hope you will not kill me.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Humh.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nAnd yet I fear you, for you\\'re fatal then\\nWhen your eyes roll so. Why I should fear I know\\nnot,\\nSince guiltiness I know not, but yet I feel I fear.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nThink on thy sins.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  They are loves I bear to you.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Ay, and for that thou diest.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nThat death\\'s unnatural that kills for loving.\\nAlas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?\\nSome bloody passion shakes your very frame.\\nThese are portents, but yet I hope, I hope\\nThey do not point on me.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Peace, and be still.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nI will so. What\\'s the matter?\\n\\nOTHELLO  That handkerchief\\nWhich I so loved, and gave thee, thou gav\\'st to\\nCassio.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nNo, by my life and soul! Send for the man\\nAnd ask him.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nSweet soul, take heed, take heed of perjury.\\nThou art on thy deathbed.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nAy, but not yet to die.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Yes, presently.\\nTherefore confess thee freely of thy sin.\\nFor to deny each article with oath\\nCannot remove nor choke the strong conception\\nThat I do groan withal. Thou art to die.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nThen Lord have mercy on me!\\n\\nOTHELLO  I say \"Amen.\"\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nAnd have you mercy, too. I never did\\nOffend you in my life, never loved Cassio\\nBut with such general warranty of heaven\\nAs I might love. I never gave him token.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nBy heaven, I saw my handkerchief in \\'s hand!\\nO perjured woman, thou dost stone my heart\\nAnd mak\\'st me call what I intend to do\\nA murder, which I thought a sacrifice!\\nI saw the handkerchief!\\n\\nDESDEMONA  He found it, then.\\nI never gave it him. Send for him hither.\\nLet him confess a truth.\\n\\nOTHELLO  He hath confessed.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  What, my lord?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nThat he hath used thee.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  How? Unlawfully?\\n\\nOTHELLO  Ay.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nHe will not say so.\\n\\nOTHELLO  No. His mouth is stopped.\\nHonest Iago hath ta\\'en order for \\'t.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nO, my fear interprets. What, is he dead?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nHad all his hairs been lives, my great revenge\\nHad stomach for them all.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nAlas, he is betrayed, and I undone.\\t[She weeps.]\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nOut, strumpet! Weep\\'st thou for him to my face?\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nO banish me, my lord, but kill me not!\\n\\nOTHELLO  Down, strumpet!\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nKill me tomorrow, let me live tonight.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Nay, if you strive--\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nBut half an hour!\\n\\nOTHELLO  Being done, there is no pause.\\n\\nDESDEMONA\\nBut while I say one prayer!\\n\\nOTHELLO  It is too late.\\n[He smothers her.]\\n\\nEMILIA, [within]\\nMy lord, my lord? What ho! My lord, my lord!\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nWhat noise is this?--Not dead? Not yet quite dead?\\nI that am cruel am yet merciful.\\nI would not have thee linger in thy pain.\\nSo, so.\\n\\nEMILIA, [within]  What, ho! My lord, my lord!\\n\\nOTHELLO  Who\\'s\\nthere?\\n\\nEMILIA, [within]\\nO, good my lord, I would speak a word with you.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nYes. \\'Tis Emilia.--By and by.--She\\'s dead.\\n\\'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio\\'s death.\\nThe noise was here. Ha, no more moving?\\nStill as the grave. Shall she come in? Were \\'t good?\\nI think she stirs again. No. What\\'s best to do?\\nIf she come in, she\\'ll sure speak to my wife.\\nMy wife, my wife! What wife? I have no wife.\\nO insupportable! O heavy hour!\\nMethinks it should be now a huge eclipse\\nOf sun and moon, and that th\\' affrighted globe\\nShould yawn at alteration.\\n\\nEMILIA, [within]  I do beseech you\\nThat I may speak with you. O, good my lord--\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nI had forgot thee. O, come in, Emilia.--\\nSoft, by and by, let me the curtains draw.--\\nWhere art thou?\\n\\n[Enter Emilia.]\\n\\nWhat\\'s the matter with thee now?\\n\\nEMILIA\\nO, my good lord, yonder\\'s foul murders done.\\n\\nOTHELLO  What? Now?\\n\\nEMILIA  But now, my lord.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nIt is the very error of the moon.\\nShe comes more nearer Earth than she was wont\\nAnd makes men mad.\\n\\nEMILIA  Cassio, my lord, hath killed\\nA young Venetian called Roderigo.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nRoderigo killed? And Cassio killed?\\n\\nEMILIA  No, Cassio is not killed.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nNot Cassio killed? Then murder\\'s out of tune,\\nAnd sweet revenge grows harsh.\\n\\nDESDEMONA  O falsely, falsely murdered.\\n\\nEMILIA\\nO Lord, what cry is that?\\n\\nOTHELLO  That? What?\\n\\nEMILIA\\nOut, and alas, that was my lady\\'s voice!\\nHelp! Help ho! Help! O lady, speak again!\\nSweet Desdemona, O sweet mistress, speak!\\n\\nDESDEMONA  A guiltless death I die.\\n\\nEMILIA  O, who hath done this deed?\\n\\nDESDEMONA  Nobody. I myself. Farewell.\\nCommend me to my kind lord. O, farewell.\\n[She dies.]\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nWhy, how should she be murdered?\\n\\nEMILIA  Alas, who\\nknows?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nYou heard her say herself, it was not I.\\n\\nEMILIA\\nShe said so. I must needs report the truth.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nShe\\'s like a liar gone to burning hell!\\n\\'Twas I that killed her.\\n\\nEMILIA\\nO, the more angel she, and you the blacker devil!\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nShe turned to folly, and she was a whore.\\n\\nEMILIA\\nThou dost belie her, and thou art a devil!\\n\\nOTHELLO  She was false as water.\\n\\nEMILIA  Thou art rash as fire to say\\nThat she was false. O, she was heavenly true!\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nCassio did top her. Ask thy husband else.\\nO, I were damned beneath all depth in hell\\nBut that I did proceed upon just grounds\\nTo this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.\\n\\nEMILIA  My husband?\\n\\nOTHELLO  Thy husband.\\n\\nEMILIA  That she was false to wedlock?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nAy, with Cassio. Had she been true,\\nIf heaven would make me such another world\\nOf one entire and perfect chrysolite,\\nI\\'d not have sold her for it.\\n\\nEMILIA  My husband?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nAy, \\'twas he that told me on her first.\\nAn honest man he is, and hates the slime\\nThat sticks on filthy deeds.\\n\\nEMILIA  My husband?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nWhat needs this iterance, woman? I say, thy\\nhusband.\\n\\nEMILIA\\nO mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!--\\nMy husband say she was false?\\n\\nOTHELLO  He, woman.\\nI say thy husband. Dost understand the word?\\nMy friend, thy husband; honest, honest Iago.\\n\\nEMILIA\\nIf he say so, may his pernicious soul\\nRot half a grain a day! He lies to th\\' heart!\\nShe was too fond of her most filthy bargain.\\n[He draws his sword.]\\n\\nOTHELLO  Hah?\\n\\nEMILIA  Do thy worst!\\nThis deed of thine is no more worthy heaven\\nThan thou wast worthy her.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Peace, you were best!\\n\\nEMILIA\\nThou hast not half that power to do me harm\\nAs I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt,\\nAs ignorant as dirt! Thou hast done a deed--\\nI care not for thy sword. I\\'ll make thee known,\\nThough I lost twenty lives. Help! Help, ho! Help!\\nThe Moor hath killed my mistress! Murder, murder!\\n\\n[Enter Montano, Gratiano, and Iago.]\\n\\n\\nMONTANO\\nWhat is the matter? How now, general?\\n\\nEMILIA\\nO, are you come, Iago? You have done well,\\nThat men must lay their murders on your neck.\\n\\nGRATIANO  What is the matter?\\n\\nEMILIA, [to Iago]\\nDisprove this villain, if thou be\\'st a man.\\nHe says thou told\\'st him that his wife was false.\\nI know thou didst not. Thou \\'rt not such a villain.\\nSpeak, for my heart is full.\\n\\nIAGO\\nI told him what I thought, and told no more\\nThan what he found himself was apt and true.\\n\\nEMILIA\\nBut did you ever tell him she was false?\\n\\nIAGO  I did.\\n\\nEMILIA\\nYou told a lie, an odious, damned lie!\\nUpon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie!\\nShe false with Cassio? Did you say with Cassio?\\n\\nIAGO\\nWith Cassio, mistress. Go to! Charm your tongue.\\n\\nEMILIA\\nI will not charm my tongue. I am bound to speak.\\nMy mistress here lies murdered in her bed.\\n\\nALL  O heavens forfend!\\n\\nEMILIA, [to Iago]\\nAnd your reports have set the murder on!\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nNay, stare not, masters; it is true indeed.\\n\\nGRATIANO  \\'Tis a strange truth.\\n\\nMONTANO\\nO monstrous act!\\n\\nEMILIA  Villainy, villainy, villainy!\\nI think upon \\'t, I think! I smell \\'t! O villainy!\\nI thought so then. I\\'ll kill myself for grief!\\nO villainy! Villainy!\\n\\nIAGO\\nWhat, are you mad? I charge you get you home.\\n\\nEMILIA\\nGood gentlemen, let me have leave to speak.\\n\\'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.\\nPerchance, Iago, I will ne\\'er go home.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nO, O, O!\\t[Othello falls on the bed.]\\n\\nEMILIA  Nay, lay thee down, and roar!\\nFor thou hast killed the sweetest innocent\\nThat e\\'er did lift up eye.\\n\\nOTHELLO, [standing]  O, she was foul!--\\nI scarce did know you, uncle. There lies your niece,\\nWhose breath indeed these hands have newly\\nstopped.\\nI know this act shows horrible and grim.\\n\\nGRATIANO\\nPoor Desdemon, I am glad thy father\\'s dead.\\nThy match was mortal to him, and pure grief\\nShore his old thread in twain. Did he live now,\\nThis sight would make him do a desperate turn,\\nYea, curse his better angel from his side,\\nAnd fall to reprobance.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\n\\'Tis pitiful. But yet Iago knows\\nThat she with Cassio hath the act of shame\\nA thousand times committed. Cassio confessed it,\\nAnd she did gratify his amorous works\\nWith that recognizance and pledge of love\\nWhich I first gave her. I saw it in his hand.\\nIt was a handkerchief, an antique token\\nMy father gave my mother.\\n\\nEMILIA  O God! O heavenly God!\\n\\nIAGO\\nZounds, hold your peace!\\n\\nEMILIA  \\'Twill out, \\'twill out. I peace?\\nNo, I will speak as liberal as the north.\\nLet heaven and men and devils, let them all,\\nAll, all, cry shame against me, yet I\\'ll speak.\\n\\nIAGO  Be wise, and get you home.\\n[He draws his sword.]\\n\\nEMILIA\\nI will not.\\n\\nGRATIANO  Fie, your sword upon a woman!\\n\\nEMILIA\\nO thou dull Moor, that handkerchief thou speak\\'st\\nof\\nI found by fortune, and did give my husband--\\nFor often, with a solemn earnestness\\n(More than indeed belonged to such a trifle),\\nHe begged of me to steal \\'t.\\n\\nIAGO  Villainous whore!\\n\\nEMILIA\\nShe give it Cassio? No, alas, I found it,\\nAnd I did give \\'t my husband.\\n\\nIAGO  Filth, thou liest!\\n\\nEMILIA\\nBy heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen!\\n[To Othello.] O murd\\'rous coxcomb, what should\\nsuch a fool\\nDo with so good a wife?\\n\\nOTHELLO  Are there no stones in heaven\\nBut what serves for the thunder?--Precious villain!\\n[The Moor runs at Iago but is disarmed.]\\n[Iago kills his wife.]\\n\\nGRATIANO\\nThe woman falls! Sure he hath killed his wife.\\n\\nEMILIA\\nAy, ay! O, lay me by my mistress\\' side.\\t[Iago exits.]\\n\\nGRATIANO  He\\'s gone, but his wife\\'s killed.\\n\\nMONTANO\\n\\'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon\\nWhich I have here recovered from the Moor.\\nCome, guard the door without. Let him not pass,\\nBut kill him rather. I\\'ll after that same villain,\\nFor \\'tis a damned slave.\\n[Montano and Gratiano exit.]\\n\\nOTHELLO  I am not valiant neither,\\nBut every puny whipster gets my sword.\\nBut why should honor outlive honesty?\\nLet it go all.\\n\\nEMILIA  What did thy song bode, lady?\\nHark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan\\nAnd die in music.\\n[She sings.]\\tWillow, willow, willow.\\nMoor, she was chaste. She loved thee, cruel Moor.\\nSo come my soul to bliss, as I speak true.\\nSo speaking as I think, alas, I die. \\t[She dies.]\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nI have another weapon in this chamber.\\nIt is a sword of Spain, the ice brook\\'s temper.\\nO, here it is.--Uncle, I must come forth.\\n\\nGRATIANO, [within]\\nIf thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear;\\nThou hast no weapon and perforce must suffer.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nLook in upon me, then, and speak with me,\\nOr naked as I am I will assault thee.\\n\\n[Enter Gratiano.]\\n\\n\\nGRATIANO\\nWhat is the matter?\\n\\nOTHELLO  Behold, I have a weapon.\\nA better never did itself sustain\\nUpon a soldier\\'s thigh. I have seen the day\\nThat with this little arm and this good sword\\nI have made my way through more impediments\\nThan twenty times your stop. But--O vain boast!--\\nWho can control his fate? \\'Tis not so now.\\nBe not afraid, though you do see me weaponed.\\nHere is my journey\\'s end, here is my butt\\nAnd very sea-mark of my utmost sail.\\nDo you go back dismayed? \\'Tis a lost fear.\\nMan but a rush against Othello\\'s breast,\\nAnd he retires. Where should Othello go?\\n[He looks toward the bed.]\\nNow, how dost thou look now? O ill-starred wench,\\nPale as thy smock, when we shall meet at compt,\\nThis look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,\\nAnd fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl?\\nEven like thy chastity.--O cursed, cursed slave!--\\nWhip me, you devils,\\nFrom the possession of this heavenly sight!\\nBlow me about in winds, roast me in sulfur,\\nWash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!\\nO Desdemon! Dead, Desdemon! Dead! O, O!\\n\\n [Enter Lodovico, Cassio in a chair, Montano, and Iago,\\nwith Officers.]\\n\\n\\nLODOVICO\\nWhere is this rash and most unfortunate man?\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nThat\\'s he that was Othello. Here I am.\\n\\nLODOVICO\\nWhere is that viper? Bring the villain forth.\\n[Iago is brought forward.]\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nI look down towards his feet; but that\\'s a fable.--\\nIf that thou be\\'st a devil, I cannot kill thee.\\n[He stabs Iago.]\\n\\nLODOVICO\\nWrench his sword from him.\\n[Othello is disarmed.]\\n\\nIAGO  I bleed, sir, but not killed.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nI am not sorry neither. I\\'d have thee live,\\nFor in my sense \\'tis happiness to die.\\n\\nLODOVICO\\nO thou Othello, that wert once so good,\\nFall\\'n in the practice of a damned slave,\\nWhat shall be said to thee?\\n\\nOTHELLO  Why, anything.\\nAn honorable murderer, if you will,\\nFor naught I did in hate, but all in honor.\\n\\nLODOVICO\\nThis wretch hath part confessed his villainy.\\nDid you and he consent in Cassio\\'s death?\\n\\nOTHELLO  Ay.\\n\\nCASSIO\\nDear general, I never gave you cause.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nI do believe it, and I ask your pardon.\\nWill you, I pray, demand that demi-devil\\nWhy he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?\\n\\nIAGO\\nDemand me nothing. What you know, you know.\\nFrom this time forth I never will speak word.\\n\\nLODOVICO  What? Not to pray?\\n\\nGRATIANO  Torments will ope your lips.\\n\\nOTHELLO  Well, thou dost best.\\n\\nLODOVICO  Sir,\\nYou shall understand what hath befall\\'n,\\nWhich, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter\\nFound in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,\\nAnd here another. [He shows papers.] The one of\\nthem imports\\nThe death of Cassio, to be undertook\\nBy Roderigo.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nO villain!\\n\\nCASSIO  Most heathenish and most gross.\\n\\nLODOVICO\\nNow here\\'s another discontented paper\\nFound in his pocket, too; and this it seems\\nRoderigo meant t\\' have sent this damned villain,\\nBut that, belike, Iago in the interim\\nCame in and satisfied him.\\n\\nOTHELLO  O, thou pernicious caitiff!--\\nHow came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief\\nThat was my wife\\'s?\\n\\nCASSIO  I found it in my chamber.\\nAnd he himself confessed it but even now,\\nThat there he dropped it for a special purpose\\nWhich wrought to his desire.\\n\\nOTHELLO  O fool, fool, fool!\\n\\nCASSIO\\nThere is besides, in Roderigo\\'s letter,\\nHow he upbraids Iago, that he made him\\nBrave me upon the watch, whereon it came\\nThat I was cast. And even but now he spake,\\nAfter long seeming dead: Iago hurt him,\\nIago set him on.\\n\\nLODOVICO, [to Othello]\\nYou must forsake this room and go with us.\\nYour power and your command is taken off,\\nAnd Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,\\nIf there be any cunning cruelty\\nThat can torment him much and hold him long,\\nIt shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,\\nTill that the nature of your fault be known\\nTo the Venetian state.--Come, bring away.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nSoft you. A word or two before you go.\\nI have done the state some service, and they\\nknow \\'t.\\nNo more of that. I pray you in your letters,\\nWhen you shall these unlucky deeds relate,\\nSpeak of me as I am. Nothing extenuate,\\nNor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak\\nOf one that loved not wisely, but too well;\\nOf one not easily jealous, but being wrought,\\nPerplexed in the extreme; of one whose hand,\\nLike the base Judean, threw a pearl away\\nRicher than all his tribe; of one whose subdued\\neyes,\\nAlbeit unused to the melting mood,\\nDrops tears as fast as the Arabian trees\\nTheir medicinable gum. Set you down this.\\nAnd say besides, that in Aleppo once,\\nWhere a malignant and a turbanned Turk\\nBeat a Venetian and traduced the state,\\nI took by th\\' throat the circumcised dog,\\nAnd smote him, thus.\\t[He stabs himself.]\\n\\nLODOVICO  O bloody period!\\n\\nGRATIANO  All that is spoke is marred.\\n\\nOTHELLO, [to Desdemona]\\nI kissed thee ere I killed thee. No way but this,\\nKilling myself, to die upon a kiss.\\t[He dies.]\\n\\nCASSIO\\nThis did I fear, but thought he had no weapon,\\nFor he was great of heart.\\n\\nLODOVICO, [to Iago]  O Spartan dog,\\nMore fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea,\\nLook on the tragic loading of this bed.\\nThis is thy work.--The object poisons sight.\\nLet it be hid.--Gratiano, keep the house,\\nAnd seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,\\nFor they succeed on you. [To Cassio.] To you, lord\\ngovernor,\\nRemains the censure of this hellish villain.\\nThe time, the place, the torture, O, enforce it.\\nMyself will straight aboard, and to the state\\nThis heavy act with heavy heart relate.\\n[They exit.]\\n'"
