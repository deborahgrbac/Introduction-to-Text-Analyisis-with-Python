    "## Introduction\n",
    "For this course, we recommend using **JupyterLab**, a powerful interactive development environment for data science and programming. JupyterLab allows you to work with **Jupyter Notebooks**, which are documents that combine **code**, **text**, and **visualizations** in a single, flexible workspace.\n",

    "With JupyterLab, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write and run code (e.g. in Python or R)  \n",
    "* Visualize data using plots and charts  \n",
    "* Document your work using Markdown (for notes, headings, equations, etc.)  \n",
    "* Manage files, terminals, and notebooks — all in one window  \n",

    "### What is a Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Jupyter Notebook** is made up of individual **cells**. Each cell has a specific role, and there are three main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code cells**: These are for writing and executing code (in this course, mainly Python).\n",
    "- **Markdown cells**: These allow you to add formatted text, notes, headers, lists, and even equations — but they are *not executable*.\n",
    "- **Raw cells**: These contain plain text and are not processed or rendered. They're rarely used by beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "A code cell can be distinguished from a markdown cell by the fact that it contains a pair of brackets with a colon to its left, like so ``[ ]:``"

In Python, any time a line is prefaced by a ``#`` that line is a comment and will not be executed if the code is run. In a code cell, comments are also blueish-green in color."
