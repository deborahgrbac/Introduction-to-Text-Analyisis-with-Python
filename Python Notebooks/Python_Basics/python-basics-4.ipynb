    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A **function** is a reusable **block of code** that performs a **specific task**. It can take **input values** (called **arguments**), process them, and optionally **return an output**. We have used several **Python functions** already, including `print()`, `input()`, and `range()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can identify a function by the fact that it ends with a set of parentheses `()` where the argument(s) can be passed into the function. Depending on the function(and your goals for using it), a function may accept no arguments, a single argument, or many arguments. For example, when we use the `print()` function, we pass a string (or a variable containing a string) as an argument. For more details, you can refer to the official Python documentation for the function you’re interested in (here’s the link for the [`print()` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries and Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "While Python comes with many functions, there are thousands more that others have written. Adding them all to Python would create mass confusion, since many people could use the same name for functions that do different things. The solution then is that **functions are stored in modules**  that can be **imported** for use. A **module** is a Python file (extension \".py\") that contains the definitions for the functions written in Python. These modules (individual Python files) can then be collected into even larger groups called **packages and libraries**. Depending on how many functions you need for the program you are writing, you may import a single module, a package of modules, or a whole library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form of importing a module is:\n",
    "`import module_name`\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here's how you can import the **`time` module** and use the `sleep()` function that will delay the code completion for a set amount of time, in this case 5 seconds."
