    "### What is a Programming Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **programming language** is a set of rules and syntax used to give instructions to a computer. It allows you to write code that the computer can execute — like giving step-by-step directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many programming languages (such as Python, JavaScript, C++, or R), each with its own strengths. \n",
    "\n",
    "The focus for these sets of textbook is **Python** a high-level, beginner-friendly programming language that is widely used in data science and machine learning. For example, as you will partially see in this course Python can be used to perform calculations, analyze data, automate repetitive tasks and create visualizations (like graphs and charts). \n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving deeper, it’s useful to know that Python comes with a set of **built-in modules** called the [Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html). These modules provide useful functions for common tasks like working with numbers, handling dates and files, and more. Using the Standard Library helps you write code more efficiently without having to build everything from scratch. Beyond the Standard Library, there are many other libraries created by the Python community. These extend Python’s capabilities to areas like data analysis, web development, and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t need to learn all these libraries right now, but knowing they exist will help you as you continue to learn and work on different projects.\n"

    "## Data Types (Integers, Floats, and Strings)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python you can process different type of data. There are three major data types:\n",

    "* integer;\n",
    "* float;\n",
    "* string;\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integers and Floats\n",
    "\n",
    "**Integers** and **floats** are **numerical data types**\n",
    "\n",
    "An **integer**, what we sometimes call a \"whole number\", is a number without a decimal point, that can be positive or negative. On the other hand, when a value uses a decimal, it is called a **float**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest operation you can do in Python programming is an mathematical expression using an operator. An **expression** is a simple mathematical statement like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1 + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can handle a large variety of expressions. When you run, or **evaluate**, an expression in Python, the order of operations is followed. This means that expressions are evaluated in this order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parentheses\n",
    "2. Exponents\n",
    "3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)\n",
    "4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main operators that you might use presented in the order they are evaluated:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Operator| Operation| Example | Evaluation |\n",
    "|---|----|---|---|\n",
    "|\\*\\*| Exponent/Power| 3 ** 3 | 27 |\n",

    "|\\*| Multiplication | 7 * 8 | 56 |\n",
    "|-| Subtraction | 18 - 4| 14|\n",

    "### Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Python it not only used for calculation but it can also help us manipulate text. A snippet of text in Python is called a **string**. \n",
