The metadata is supplied in a CSV file and the full dataset is supplied in a compressed JSON Lines file (.jsonl.gz). For analysis focused on metadata, we recommend users start with the CSV file since it is both easier and faster to view, parse, and manipulate. If you need access to n-grams or full-text, then you want the full JSON lines file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metadata CSV vs. JSON Lines Data File\n",
    "All of the textual data and metadata is available inside of the JSON Lines files, but we have chosen to offer the metadata CSV for two primary reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The JSON Lines data is a little more complex to parse since it is nested. It cannot be easily represented in a table form in something like Pandas. It is nice to be able to easily view all the metadata in a Pandas dataframe.\n",
    "2. The JSON Lines data can be very large. Each file contains all of the metadata *plus* unigram counts, bigram counts, trigram counts, and full-text (when available). Manipulating all that data takes significant computer time and costs. Even a modest dataset (~5000 files) can be over 1 GB in size uncompressed.\n",
